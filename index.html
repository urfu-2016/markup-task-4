                <h3>HER ROYAL HOTNESS: Prince Harry secretly dating US TV star Meghan Markle</h3>
                <h5>PRINCE HARRY is secretly dating a stunning US actress, model and human rights
                    campaigner.</h5>
                <p>
                    Friends say the red&shy;haired ro&shy;y&shy;al Ro&shy;me&shy;o, of&shy;ten dubbed
                    the world’s most el&shy;i&shy;gi&shy;ble
                    bach&shy;e&shy;lor, has fall&shy;en for 35&shy;year&shy;old Meghan Markle.
                    In&shy;sid&shy;ers say Har&shy;ry, 32, is
                    “be&shy;sot&shy;ted” with the ac&shy;tress, best known for her role as
                    Ra&shy;chel Zane in A&shy;mer&shy;i&shy;can TV le&shy;gal dra&shy;ma Suits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In re&shy;cent weeks ro&shy;y&shy;al watch&shy;ers have no&shy;ticed that
                    Har&shy;ry, fifth&shy;in&shy;line to the
                    throne, has had a no&shy;ta&shy;ble spring in his step and can’t stop smil&shy;in&shy;g.
                    “He’s hap&shy;pi&shy;er than he’s been for man&shy;y years,” said a source close to the
                    Prince last night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He’s in a ver&shy;y re&shy;laxed pe&shy;ri&shy;od of his life and Meghan has come
                    a&shy;long at the
                    right time. “They are tak&shy;in&shy;g each week as it comes and just
                    en&shy;joy&shy;in&shy;g each
                    oth&shy;er’s com&shy;pa&shy;ny but it’s fair to say that they love see&shy;in&shy;g
                    each oth&shy;er and
                    there’s a def&shy;i&shy;nite chem&shy;is&shy;try be&shy;tween them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Har&shy;ry has been des&shy;per&shy;ate to keep the re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship
                    qui&shy;et be&shy;cause he doesn’t
                    want to scare Meghan off. He knows things will change when their ro&shy;mance
                    is pub&shy;lic knowl&shy;edge but he al&shy;so knows he can’t keep it a se&shy;cret
                    for long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s too ear&shy;ly to say if the re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship will lead to
                    an&shy;y&shy;thing long&shy;term
                    but who knows? At the mo&shy;ment they are just tak&shy;in&shy;g it a step at a time
                    and see&shy;in&shy;g how things de&shy;vel&shy;op.”
                    It is thought Har&shy;ry met Meghan in May when he was in To&shy;ron&shy;to
                    to pro&shy;mote the
                    Invictus Ga&shy;mes
                    for dis&shy;a&shy;bled Servicemen. Meghan, who was born in Los An&shy;geles,
                    has lived in
                    To&shy;ron&shy;to
                    for sev&shy;er&shy;al years and made it her home be&shy;cause Suits is filmed there.
                    She mar&shy;ried her long&shy;term boy&shy;friend, film pro&shy;duc&shy;er
                    Trev&shy;or Engelson, in Ja&shy;mai&shy;ca
                    in 2011,
                    but the cou&shy;&shy;ple split af&shy;ter just two years. Some claim they have
                    di&shy;vorced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oth&shy;ers say they are still mar&shy;ried but sep&shy;a&shy;rat&shy;ed.
                    I&shy;ron&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly Engelson, 40, bears a close phys&shy;i&shy;cal
                    sim&shy;i&shy;lar&shy;i&shy;ty to Har&shy;ry.
                    Meghan’s most re&shy;cent
                    boy&shy;friend was a top To&shy;ron&shy;to chef, but at the mo&shy;ment she
                    lives with just
                    her two res&shy;cue
                    dogs Bo&shy;gart and Guy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She has made sev&shy;er&shy;al vis&shy;its to Lon&shy;don and has been on
                    dis&shy;creet din&shy;ners with
                    Har&shy;ry and
                    out with his friends. Friends say Har&shy;ry has been treat&shy;ed to her
                    “ex&shy;ce&shy;l&shy;lent
                    cook&shy;in&shy;g” and they both en&shy;joy yo&shy;ga.
                    She has stayed with him at Ken&shy;sing&shy;ton PAL&shy;ace and met the Duke
                    and Duch&shy;ess of
                    Cam&shy;bridge.
                    “Wil&shy;li&shy;am and Kate re&shy;al&shy;ly liked her and she fit&shy;ted in
                    straight a&shy;way,” add&shy;ed
                    the in&shy;sid&shy;er.

                    say experts</h3>
                <h5>A HARD Brexit could see Britain more than double the amount it currently earns

                <p>
                    Change Brit&shy;ain found 14 coun&shy;tries – in&shy;clud&shy;ing Chi&shy;na,
                    Bra&shy;zil, In&shy;di&shy;a and
                    Aus&shy;tral&shy;i&shy;a have pub&shy;lic&shy;ly ex&shy;pressed a de&shy;sire to
                    strike a trade deal with Brit&shy;ain
                    once The&shy;re&shy;sa May fi&shy;nal&shy;ly trig&shy;gers Ar&shy;ti&shy;cle 50.
                    The com&shy;bined e&shy;co&shy;nom&shy;ic worth of the 14 na&shy;tions who say they
                    want trade deals with
                    Brit&shy;ain a&shy;mounts to £17tril&shy;lion – more than dou&shy;ble the

                    GDP of na&shy;tions who have deals with the EU.

                    John&shy;son – warned that
                    Brit&shy;ain will

                    should the Prime Min&shy;is&shy;ter pull
