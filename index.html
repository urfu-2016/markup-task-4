            <h2>Han Solo Movie’s Donald Glover ‘Honored’ to Play Lando</h2>
            <h3 class="author">By Stephen Silver</h3>
            <div class="col-2">
                <p>
                    It’s been a very good year in 2016 for actor Donald Glover, across
                    mul&shy;ti&shy;ple mediums. Fol&shy;lowing his acclaimed turn in last
                    year’s The Mar&shy;tian movie, Glover’s album under his rap al&shy;ter
                    ego, Child&shy;ish Gambino, Because The Inter&shy;net, was certi&shy;fied
                    gold. His FX hip-hop drama, Atlanta, has drawn rave crit&shy;ical reviews
                    and was picked up almost im&shy;me&shy;diately for a sec&shy;ond sea&shy;son.
                    And last week, he won the coveted role of Lando Calrissian in the
                    upcom&shy;ing standalone Star Wars anthology film about Han Solo.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Lando Calrissian action figure was the first toy he ever had
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    In the film from di&shy;rectors Chris Miller and Phil Lord (21 Jump Street,
                    The LEGO Movie), Glover will step into the shoes of Billy Dee Williams, who
                    played Lando in The Em&shy;pire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi; he’ll be
                    appearing oppo&shy;site Alden Ehrenreich, who will be playing the part made
                    icon&shy;ic by Harri&shy;son Ford. The film starts production early next year
                    with the re&shy;lease date set for late spring in 2018. Most Star Wars fans
                    seem pretty happy with the cast&shy;ing of Glover, and it appears the actor
                    him&shy;self is happy to have won the role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an appear&shy;ance on The Ellen Show Wednesday (see above), Glover
                    ex&shy;pressed his grat&shy;i&shy;tude over having been cast in such
                    an icon&shy;ic part. Glover told Ellen DeGeneres that he is “honored”
                    to have tak&shy;en the role, and to be part of Star Wars. The actor
                    said he’s loved the Star Wars films ev&shy;er since he was a child –
                    ref&shy;erenc&shy;ing the viral photo of Glover wearing a Star Wars
                    t-shirt as a high school student. He even shared that a Lando Calrissian
                    action fig&shy;ure was the first toy he ev&shy;er had, along with one of
                    Darth Vad&shy;er.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While life&shy;long affin&shy;ity for Star Wars is by no means a
                    pre&shy;req&shy;ui&shy;site for in&shy;volve&shy;ment in the present
                    movies, there’s some&shy;thing to be said for life&shy;long pas&shy;sion
                    for the ma&shy;te&shy;rial. And that’s some&shy;thing Glover clearly has,
                    whether it’s Star Wars or Spi&shy;der-man — an&shy;oth&shy;er
                    fran&shy;chise Glover publicly campaigned to partic&shy;ipate in,
                    and ul&shy;ti&shy;mately landed a role in Spi&shy;der-man: Home&shy;com&shy;ing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The question will be, can Glover and Ehrenreich recre&shy;ate the chem&shy;istry,
                    and the complicated relation&shy;ship, that we saw be&shy;tween Han and Lando
                    back when Ford and Williams played the parts? The pre&shy;vi&shy;ous actors,
                    in lim&shy;ited screen time, conveyed a whole lot of complex and shared history.
                    When it comes time to show us that history, are the new actors up to it? Based
                    on what we’ve seen from them in past roles, they certainly seem up to the task.

            <h2>The Incredibles 2 is Coming A Year Sooner; Toy Story 4 Delayed</h2>

                    Pixar studios is known for its orig&shy;inal programming, but over re&shy;cent
                    years the ani&shy;mation power&shy;house has been relying more on sequels for
                    its out&shy;put. This summer, Find&shy;ing Dory became Pixar’s lat&shy;est
                    crit&shy;ical and commercial smash (read our review), and three of their
                    next four films are all fol&shy;lowups to pre-exis&shy;t&shy;ing
                    prop&shy;er&shy;ties. These include the long-await&shy;ed The
                    In&shy;cred&shy;ibles 2 (written and di&shy;rected by Brad Bird) and a fourth
                    in&shy;stall&shy;ment in Pixar’s flag&shy;ship Toy Story fran&shy;chise – the
                    aptly-named Toy Story 4, which will be helmed by John Las&shy;seter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Pixar plotted out their sched&shy;ule for the next few years, the
                    pre&shy;vi&shy;ous plan was for Toy Story 4 to pre&shy;miere in June 2018,
                    while In&shy;cred&shy;ibles 2 would finally debut in June 2019. Now that
                    both projects are making their way through devel&shy;op&shy;ment, some
                    al&shy;terations have been made to the production time&shy;lines, and
                    the two films have swapped re&shy;lease dates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disney/Pixar have confirmed the date changes, with THR reporting that
                    an accel&shy;erated sched&shy;ule for The In&shy;cred&shy;ibles 2 was
                    what led to the change. Since The In&shy;cred&shy;ibles 2 is undoubtedly
                    one of the most-de&shy;manded Pixar sequels, this devel&shy;op&shy;ment
                    will come as a pleas&shy;ant surprise for fans. Now, the Parr fam&shy;ily
                    will return to the big screen a year earli&shy;er than antic&shy;ipated.
                    As it stands now, The In&shy;cred&shy;ibles 2 will open on June 15, 2018,
                    and Toy Story 4 will reach the&shy;aters June 21, 2019.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last year, Tom Hanks indicated that he would be&shy;gin record&shy;ing his
                    Woody lines for Toy Story 4 in December 2015, so the re&shy;lease date switch
                    is a bit cu&shy;rious. What&shy;ev&shy;er the reasoning is, it would appear
                    that The In&shy;cred&shy;ibles 2 is the one that’s fur&shy;ther along in
                    pre-production and ready to move on to the next phase. The move does al&shy;low
                    Las&shy;seter and the Toy Story 4 team more time to finalize their narrative,
                    which certainly can’t hurt. Toy Story 3 is a be&shy;loved modern classic that
                    ended the orig&shy;inal trilogy on an emotionally res&shy;o&shy;nant note.
                    Many remain skeptical of a fourth entry in the se&shy;ries, even one that
                    promises to be a touch&shy;ing love story be&shy;tween Woody and Bo Peep.
                    It’s better Pixar not rush any&shy;thing since expectations will be very high.

            <h2>Doctor Strange Diagnoses the Avengers’ Injuries in New Video</h2>
            <h3 class="author">By James Roberts</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Let's be hon&shy;est: It's hard work be&shy;ing a superhero. On top of all the
                    heavy lifting and train&shy;ing you’d need to do in or&shy;der to stay in such
                    peak phys&shy;ical con&shy;dition, there are all the bumps and bruises earned
                    in the course of bat&shy;tle. You don’t just take mul&shy;ti&shy;ple punches
                    to the face with&shy;out their be&shy;ing some dam&shy;age, especially from
                    the likes of Captain America and Iron Man. This is a fact they both learned
                    earli&shy;er this year in Captain America: Civ&shy;il War.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As fun as it might have been to watch Robert Downey Jr. (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang)
                    and Chris Evans (Snowpiercer) exchange verbal and phys&shy;ical blows in this
                    year’s high&shy;est gross&shy;ing film, in re&shy;al life there’d be some
                    pretty se&shy;rious phys&shy;ical and med&shy;ical consequences for these
                    kinds of fights. While over in Hell’s Kitchen, The Defend&shy;ers have their
                    own med&shy;ical as&shy;sistance from the likes of Rosar&shy;io Daw&shy;son’s
                    (Sin City: A Dame to Kill For) Claire Temple, as of yet The Avengers haven’t
                    had a med&shy;ical pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al to han&shy;dle their lev&shy;el
                    of mayhem. Not for an&shy;oth&shy;er couple of weeks, at least, when Doctor
                    Strange hits the&shy;aters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a new promotional video for the upcom&shy;ing film, Doctor Strange
                    him&shy;self, Bene&shy;dict Cumberbatch (Sh&shy;erlock), uses his vast
                    knowl&shy;edge of medicine to diagnose some of the many, many injuries
                    giv&shy;en (and received) in Captain America: Civ&shy;il War.
                    The tongue-in-cheek promo serves to high&shy;light both Dr. Stephen
                    Strange’s actual med&shy;ical train&shy;ing in addition to tout&shy;ing
                    the stunning vi&shy;su&shy;al leap made in the next chap&shy;ter of the

                    Strange, of course, is a ta&shy;l&shy;ented and respected surgeon whose life
                    is changed af&shy;ter an accident causes a loss of mobility in his hands.
                    Un&shy;able to practice medicine, a de&shy;pressed Dr. Strange trav&shy;els
                    the world seeking meaning when he stumbles across a re&shy;alm of magic and
                    new dimen&shy;sions. With some train&shy;ing from Tilda Swinton’s (Hail,
                    Caesar!) The An&shy;cient One, the good doctor learns to tap into the
                    mys&shy;tical ener&shy;gies of the uni&shy;verse to find a new purpose.

                    While lit&shy;tle is giv&shy;en away, it does pro­vide an
