            Not since Robin Hood has there been such a spectac&shy;ular and flercely patri&shy;ot&shy;ic folk 
            hero as James Bond. Since his dash&shy;ing debut in 1953 in the book "Casino Royale" he has 
            emphat&shy;ically become the most awesome secret agent in the world. A lonewolf locensed to 
            kill and la&shy;dykill he has also made an&shy;oth&shy;er kind of killing in the 
            cin&shy;ema where he is undis&shy;puted king of the box-office.

                A sort of one-main export over drive, the first three Bond pic&shy;tures have now been seen 
                by more than 100 million people around the world and earned a massive $75 million.
                Now Bond IV - <q>"Thunder-ball"</q> – has opened. Almost as inevitable 
                as Bond's ul&shy;ti&shy;mate triumph over such powerful evils as Smersh and Spectre. 
                movie records will fall to this film.
            </p>
            <h2>Envied</h2>
            <p>
                Bond is a veri&shy;ta&shy;ble queue-making ma&shy;ch&shy;ine.
                Admired, envied, despired, hated, aped, and attacked? Ian Flem&shy;ing's hero is
                pos&shy;itively the most discussed and compulsive invention of our time.
                But exactly what is the iresis&shy;tible appeal of this man called Bond? There
                have been oth&shy;er spies, oth&shy;er heroes, oth&shy;er special agents – think of Dick
                Barton, Bulldog Drummond, nero Wolfe, and Chan&shy;dler's mem&shy;o&shy;rable Philip
                Marlowe – but none has achieved the same pas&shy;sion&shy;ate popular&shy;ity as 007.
                Yet certainly Drummond could match his nick-of-timing, Wolfe is in the same
                sybarit&shy;ic league and Chan&shy;dler certainly had more razored dia&shy;logue.
                So what precisely does Bond have that somehow eluded the rest? Ba&shy;sically
                it is a cunning com&shy;pound of ism. An amalgam of such raw ingre&shy;di&shy;ents as
                sexualism, sadism, cyn&shy;icism, witticism. You might also throw in eroticism,
                pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;alism, magnetism, and even patri&shy;o&shy;tism.
                (It is notewor&shy;thy that not a single villain in Bond's escapades is British.
                Russians, Germans, Kore&shy;ans, but nev&shy;er British.)
            </p>
            <h2>Villain</h2>
            <p>
                The villain in "Thundeball" is one Largo, an
                Itelian with black eye patch and ghost-white hair. And it is in this film that
                the essentialisms of Bond can be observed in action. The story is not 15 minutes
                old before we are treated to a soupcon, of sensu&shy;alism in mink gloves, a Jet-Pack
                of escapism and a whole load of vintage Bond cyn&shy;icism.
                Now read on: The initials of the cof&shy;fin drape were J.B. James Bond watched the
                fu&shy;neral ser&shy;vice from the gallery, a rather more comfort&shy;able po&shy;sition 
                than the occupant of the oak cas&shy;ket. The woman by his side, Mademoi&shy;selle La Porte, 
                said soft&shy;ly: <q>"At least you've been saved the effort of removing 
                him. Colonel Bouvar passed away in his sleep, I'm told."</q>
                The sadness of Bond;s face was not the sadness of the be&shy;reaved. 
                <q>"You look disap&shy;pointed you did not kill him your&shy;self?"</q> 
                said Mademoi&shy;selle La Porte. <q>"I am, Jacques Bouvar murdered two of 
                my col&shy;leagues,"</q> said Bond. Out&shy;side the
                small church just out&shy;side Paris, he watched the wid&shy;ow Bouvar open the door of
                the black li&shy;mou&shy;sine and climb in.
                Some&shy;thing hap&shy;pened in Bond's face that was suddenly close to pleasure. The
                wid&shy;ow Bouvar's mourning would be la&shy;mentably short. Bond knew he would kill her 
                When she arrived at her chateau James Bond was wait&shy;ing for her. 
                <q>"Madame, I have come to offer my sin&shy;cere con&shy;do&shy;lences,"
                </q> he said as his fist sma&shy;shed through her black veil. <q>"I 
                don't think you should have ope&shy;ned that car door by your&shy;self my dear 
                Colonel Bouvar."</q>

            <h2>Violent</h2>
            <p>
                Bouvar, his veil and wig torn aside to re&shy;veal
                the hideous make up on his hard face, climbed to his feet. The fight was good
                and Bouver died vio&shy;lently, stran&shy;gled with an iron poker.
                Thi sudden sav&shy;age sadism ended – and note the pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;alism with 
                which it was accomplished – James Bond makes his 1966 get&shy;away. No wait&shy;ing, 
                revved-up car for him.
                For james Bond has tak&shy;en the hero into the mir&shy;acle of the Space Age. Marlowe
                and Wolfe and dear old Dick Barton were finally caught in a world of
                street-corner re&shy;alism, born at a time when 90 on the clock meant a fast
                car.They were for ev&shy;er earth&shy;bound by convention.
            </p>
            <h2>Fantasy</h2>
            <p>
                Bond has bro&shy;ken away, tak&shy;en the fanta&shy;sy of the
                com&shy;ic strip and giv&shy;en it a pop art re&shy;ality. Hilar&shy;ious yet odd&shy;ly 
                logical. It is part of his extraor&shy;dinary cunning of mixing excapism with a sence of fast
                approach&shy;ing re&shy;alism that Bond is now.
                So: having disman&shy;tled the life of Colonel Bouvar Bond straps on his U.S.
                Jet-Pack and simply flies away. <q>"No well-dressed man should be 
                with&shy;out one,"</q> he murmurs.
                So far, so fast. But even James Bond sometimes must rest. He re&shy;treats to a
                health farm where the farm&shy;ers are nat&shy;urally very young very pretty, and very
                fem&shy;i&shy;nine. Pat is the masseuse with the mostest–including a mink glove to soothe
                away Mr. Bond's ten&shy;sions.
                This of course is the brand of medicinal sensu&shy;alism that James Bond thrives on.
                He is soon on his feet again.
                But even a country health farm is not a haven of rest when Bond is about.
                Strapped to a motorised traction table, an intru&shy;ment for stretch&shy;ing the spine.
                Bond is almost stretched from here to eter&shy;nity when a villain switches
                it to maximum power.
                <q>"Somebody,"</q> grits Bond when freed,
                <q>"is go&shy;ing to pay for this."</q>
