                            <q>We needed help from the team to remain on top and they did that
                                by running and pressing high. Starting from the goalkeeper to the striker we
                                are doing a
                                great job

                        <p>
                            <q>It was a tough game. Southampton started very well, pressing high, and we had a
                                little
                                difficulty but

                            agreed
                            Cahill. We have
                            worked hard in training. Every player has worked hard on the shape the manager has
                            brought
                            in and we are
                            getting the rewards, but it is alright having the shape, it is also to do with
                            having the
                            players with
                            the mentality to go out and do the business when we need to.

                            campaign,

                            voluntarily agree
                            to pay every
                            member of staff over the age of 18 a higher wage, in line with the cost of living
                            and
                            significantly

                            Manchester
                            United</h4>
                        <p>
                            It was an emphatic victory and one which saw us move above Tottenham into fourth
                            position
                            courtesy of a
                            superior goal difference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pedro scored the quickest goal of the Premier League season, inside 30 seconds, to
                            give us
                            the lead
                            before Cahill doubled our advantage with a close-range finish. Hazard added a
                            third before
                            N’Golo Kante
                            scored a brilliant fourth, his first for the club.

                            ‘We dominated from the first minute to the last and it was really impressive from
                            us. We’re
                            very pleased

                            Cahill’s goal was his first of the campaign, and he was pleased to get off the
                            mark in such
                            an important
                            game. ‘It dropped perfectly for me and I couldn’t miss,’ he said. ‘I was delighted
                            to get a
                            goal, it put
                            us 2-0 up and in the Premier League it’s very difficult to come back from 2-0
                            down.’

                        <p>
                            Hazard was outstanding once more, as he was against Leicester a week ago, and the
                            Belgian
                            believes the
                            fact we overcame a strong opponent was particularly significant. ‘It gives a lot
                            of
                            confidence,’ he
                            said. ‘We started well and for the fans and us it was a great afternoon. It was a
                            big game
                            and we’ve
                            already lost big games this season against Liverpool and Arsenal, so we did well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‘We’ve stopped letting goals in and naturally that breeds confidence. We need to
                            stay in
                            contention,
                            stay up there. It’s going to be tight until the end of the season because there
                            are some
                            terrific teams
                            up there.’
