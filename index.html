                Wherefore art thou, Romeo? Shakespeare’s missing men of 1916
            </div>
            <p>Countless cele&shy;brati&shy;ons are taking place across the country 
            to commemo&shy;ra&shy;te the 400th annivers&shy;ary of Wil&shy;liam 
            Shakespeare’s de&shy;ath. Wherever you live, you’ll find para&shy;des, 
            talks and per&shy;forman&shy;ces of all kinds paying homage to the Bard’s work, 
            but it was a very different story 100 years ago.On the tercen&shy;ten&shy;ary 
            of Shakespeare’s de&shy;ath in 1916, 
            Britain had found its&shy;elf in the middle of one of the most horrific 
            battles in history. While the odd commemo&shy;rative event took place in 
            lar&shy;ger cities, one re&shy;ader of the Sh&shy;effield Eve&shy;ning Te&shy;
            le&shy;graph sent a he&shy;art-breaking let&shy;ter explai&shy;ning one very 
            practical re&shy;ason why cele&shy;brati&shy;ons could not be as vib&shy;rant 
            as previously ho&shy;ped.</p>

                London History
            </div>
            <p>London (the capi&shy;tal city of Eng&shy;land and the United Kingdom) 
            has a history dating back over 2,000 years. During this time, it has grown to 
            beco&shy;me one of the most si&shy;gnifi&shy;cant fi&shy;nanci&shy;al and 
            cultu&shy;ral capitals on Earth. It has expe&shy;ri&shy;en&shy;ced plague, 
            deva&shy;stating fire, civil war, aeri&shy;al bombardment, terrorist attacks, 
            and wides&shy;pre&shy;ad rioting. The City of London is its his&shy;toric core 
            and today is its pri&shy;mary fi&shy;nanci&shy;al district, though it now 
            re&shy;p&shy;res&shy;ents a tiny part of the wider metropolis of Grea&shy;ter London.
            According to the legendary His&shy;toria Regum Britanniae, by Geoff&shy;rey of Monmouth, 
            London was founded by Brutus of Troy about 1000–1100 B.C. af&shy;ter he defeated the 
            native gi&shy;ant Gogmagog; the settlement was known as Caer Troia, Troia Nova 
            (La&shy;tin for New Troy), which, according to a pseudo-etymology, was corrupted 
            to Trinovan&shy;tum. Trinovantes we&shy;re the Iron Age tribe who inhab&shy;i&shy;ted 
            the area pri&shy;or to the Ro&shy;mans. Geoff&shy;rey pro&shy;vides prehis&shy;toric 
            London wi&shy;th a rich array of legendary kings, such as Lud (see also Lludd, 
            from Welsh mythology) who, he claims, re&shy;named the town Caer Ludein, from 
            which London was derived, and was bu&shy;ried at Ludgate.</p>
