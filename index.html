                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The author, (Sir) Arthur Conan-Doyle wrote his first Holmes story, A Study In Scarlet,
                    in 1886. Sherlock Holmes, a fictitious character was based on a real man, Dr Joseph Bell,
                    a renown forensic scientist at Edinburgh University whom Conan-Doyle studied under.
                    Conan-Doyle wrote 56 self contained short stories &amp; 4 novels (60 adventures in total)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The collection is known as The Cannon.
                    The first Sherlock Holmes film was produced in 1900. In 1939 the novels were developed
                    as a series of films staring Basil Rathbone, establishing the trademark deerstalker, pipe
                    &amp; spyglass as a global visual icon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories that feature Holmes. The first
                    two stories, short novels appeared in Beeton’s Christmas Annual for 1887 and Lippincott’s
                    Monthly Magazine in 1890, respectively.The character grew tremendously in popularity with
                    the beginning of the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine in 1891; further
                    series of short stories and two serialised novels appeared until 1927. The stories cover a
                    period from around 1878 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914.All but four stories are
                    narrated by Holmes’s friend and biographer, Dr John H. Watson; two are narrated by Sherlock
                    Holmes himself, and two others are written in the third person.Conan Doyle said that the
                    character of Holmes was inspired by Dr Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had  worked as a clerk at
                    the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Sherlock Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large
                    conclusions from the smallest observations.

                <h2>Life with Watson</h2>
                Holmes worked as a detective for twenty-three years, with physician John Watson assisting him for seventeen.
                They were roommates before Watson's 1887 marriage and again after his wife's death. Their residence is
                maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson. Most of the stories are frame narratives, written from Watson's
                point of view as summaries of the detective's most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson's
                writing sensational and populist, suggesting that it fails to accurately and objectively report the "science"
                of his craft:
                <q>
                    Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional
                    manner. You have attempted to tinge it ["A Study in Scarlet"] with romanticism, which produces much the
                    same effect as if you worked a love-story .... Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just
                    sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved
                    mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it
                </q>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, Holmes's friendship with Watson is his most significant relationship. When Watson is injured
                    by a bullet, although the wound turns out to be "quite superficial", Watson is moved by Holmes's reaction:
                </p>
                <q>
                    It was worth a wound; it was worth many wounds; to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that
                    cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and
                    only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but
                    single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation
                </q>

                <h2>Finances</h2>
                <p>
                    During his career, Holmes works for the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe (including
                    his own), wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, and impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses.
                    Although when the stories begin Holmes initially needed Watson to share the rent for their residence
                    at 221B Baker Street, by the time of "The Final Problem", he says that his services to the government
                    of France and the royal house of Scandinavia had left him with enough money to retire comfortably. The
                    detective is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem's
                    solution; in "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" he says that Helen Stoner may pay any expenses he
                    incurs, and asks the bank in "The Red-Headed League" to reimburse him for money spent solving the case.
                    Holmes has his wealthy banker client in "The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet" pay the costs of recovering
                    the stolen gems, and claims the reward posted for their recovery. In "The Problem of Thor Bridge" the
                    detective says, "My professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save when I remit
                    [omit] them altogether". In this context a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that
                    wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The detective tells Watson, in "A Case of Identity", about a gold snuff box received from the King
                    of Bohemia after "A Scandal in Bohemia" and about a valuable ring given to him by the Dutch royal family;
                    in "The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans", he receives an emerald tie pin from Queen Victoria. In
                    "The Adventure of the Priory School" Holmes rubs his hands with glee when the Duke of Holdernesse mentions
                    his ₤6,000 fee, the amount of which surprises even Watson (at a time where annual expenses for a rising
                    young professional were in the area of ₤500).

                    <h2>Drug</h2>
                    <p>
                        Holmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases. He uses
                        cocaine, which he injects in a seven-percent solution with a syringe kept in a Morocco leather case.
                        Although Holmes also dabbles in morphine, he expresses strong disapproval when he visits an opium den;
                        both drugs were legal in late-19th-century England. Watson and Holmes use tobacco, smoking cigarettes,
                        cigars, and pipes, and the detective is an expert at identifying tobacco-ash residue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a physician Watson strongly disapproves of his friend's cocaine habit, describing it as the detective's
                        "only vice", and concerned about its effect on Holmes's mental health and intellect. In "The Adventure of
                        the Missing Three-Quarter" Watson says that although he has "weaned" Holmes from drugs, he remains an addict
                        whose habit is "not dead, but merely sleeping".
