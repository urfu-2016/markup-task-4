                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The au&shy;thor, (Sir) Ar&shy;thur Con&shy;an-Doyle wrote his first
                        Holmes story, A Study In Scar&shy;let,in 1886. Sher&shy;lock Holmes
                        a fic&shy;ti&shy;tious char&shy;ac&shy;ter was based on a real man,
                        Dr Joseph Bell, a renown forensic sci&shy;ent&shy;ist at Ed&shy;
                        in&shy;burgh Uni&shy;versity whom Con&shy;an-Doyle stud&shy;ied
                        un&shy;der. Con&shy;an-Doyle wrote 56 self con&shy;tained short
                        stor&shy;ies &amp; 4 nov&shy;els (60 ad&shy;ven&shy;tures in total)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The col&shy;lec&shy;tion is known as The Can&shy;non. The first Sher&shy;
                        lock Holmes film was pro&shy;duced in 1900. In 1939 the nov&shy;els were
                        de&shy;veloped as a series of films star&shy;ing Basil Rath&shy;bone,
                        es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing the trade&shy;mark deer&shy;stalk&shy;er,
                        pipe &amp; spy&shy;glass as a glob&shy;al visu&shy;al icon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Con&shy;an Doyle wrote four nov&shy;els and fifty-six short stor&shy;ies
                        that fea&shy;ture Holmes. The first two stor&shy;ies, short nov&shy;els
                        ap&shy;peared in Bee&shy;ton’s Christ&shy;mas An&shy;nu&shy;al for 1887
                        and Lip&shy;pin&shy;cott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890, re&shy;spect&shy;ively.
                        The char&shy;ac&shy;ter grew tre&shy;mend&shy;ously in pop&shy;ular&shy;ity
                        with the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of the first series of short stor&shy;ies in
                        The Strand Magazine in 1891; fur&shy;ther series of short stor&shy;ies and
                        two seri&shy;al&shy;ised nov&shy;els ap&shy;peared un&shy;til 1927. The
                        stor&shy;ies cov&shy;er a peri&shy;od from around 1878 up to 1907, with a
                        fi&shy;nal case in 1914.All but four stor&shy;ies are nar&shy;rated by
                        Holmes’s friend and bio&shy;graph&shy;er, Dr John H. Wat&shy;son; two are
                        nar&shy;rated by Sher&shy;lock Holmes him&shy;self, and two oth&shy;ers are
                        writ&shy;ten in the third per&shy;son.Con&shy;an Doyle said that the
                        char&shy;ac&shy;ter of Holmes was in&shy;spired by Dr Joseph Bell, for
                        whom Doyle had  worked as a clerk at the Ed&shy;in&shy;burgh Roy&shy;al
                        In&shy;firm&shy;ary. Like Sher&shy;lock Holmes, Bell was noted for
                        draw&shy;ing large con&shy;clu&shy;sions from the smal&shy;lest ob&shy;ser&shy;
                        va&shy;tions.

                    <h2>Life with Watson</h2>
                    <p>
                        Holmes worked as a de&shy;tect&shy;ive for twenty-three years,
                        with phys&shy;i&shy;cian John Wat&shy;son as&shy;sist&shy;ing
                        him for sev&shy;en&shy;teen.They were room&shy;mates be&shy;fore
                        Wat&shy;son's 1887 mar&shy;riage and again after his wife's death.
                        Their res&shy;id&shy;ence is main&shy;tained by their land&shy;lady,
                        Mrs. Hud&shy;son. Most of the stor&shy;ies are frame nar&shy;rat&shy;
                        ives, writ&shy;ten from Wat&shy;son's point of view as
                        sum&shy;mar&shy;ies of the de&shy;tect&shy;ive's most
                        in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing cases. Holmes fre&shy;quently
                        calls Wat&shy;son's writ&shy;ing sen&shy;sa&shy;tion&shy;al
                        and pop&shy;u&shy;list,sug&shy;gest&shy;ing that it fails to
                        ac&shy;cur&shy;ately and ob&shy;ject&shy;ively re&shy;port the
                        "sci&shy;ence" of his craft:
                    </p>
                    <q>
                        De&shy;tec&shy;tion is, or ought to be, an ex&shy;act sci&shy;ence and
                        should be treated in the same cold and un&shy;emo&shy;tion&shy;al
                        man&shy;ner. You have at&shy;temp&shy;ted to tinge it["A Study in
                        Scar&shy;let"] with ro&shy;man&shy;ti&shy; cism, which pro&shy;duces
                        much the sameef&shy;fect as if you worked a love-story .... Some facts
                        should be sup&shy;pressed,or, at least, a just sense of
                        pro&shy;por&shy;tion should be ob&shy;served in treat&shy;ing them.
                        The only point in the case which de&shy;served men&shy;tion was the
                        curi&shy;ous ana&shy;lyt&shy;ic&shy;al reas&shy;on&shy; ing from
                        ef&shy;fects to causes, by which I suc&shy;ceeded in
                        un&shy;rav&shy;el&shy;ling it.
                    </q>
                    <p>
                        Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less, Holmes's friend&shy;ship with Wat&shy;son
                        is his most sig&shy;ni&shy;fic&shy;ant re&shy;la&shy;tion&shy;ship.
                        When Wat&shy;son is in&shy;jured by a bul&shy;let, al&shy;though the
                        wound turns out to be "quite su&shy;per&shy;fi&shy;cial", Wat&shy;son
                        is moved by Holmes's re&shy;ac&shy;tion:
                    </p>
                    <q>
                        It was worth a wound; it was worth many wounds; to know the depth of
                        loy&shy;alty and love which lay be&shy;hind that cold mask. The clear,
                        hard eyes were dimmed for a mo&shy;ment, and the firm lips were
                        shak&shy;ing. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great
                        heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded
                        ser&shy;vice cul&shy;min&shy;ated in that mo&shy;ment of
                        rev&shy;el&shy;a&shy;tion

                    <h2>Finances</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dur&shy;ing his ca&shy;reer, Holmes works for the most power&shy;ful
                        mon&shy;archs and gov&shy;ern&shy;ments of Europe (in&shy;clud&shy;ing
                        his own), wealthy ar&shy;is&shy;to&shy;crats and in&shy;dus&shy;tri&shy;
                        al&shy;ists, and  im&shy;pov&shy;er&shy;ished pawn&shy;brokers and
                        gov&shy;ernesses. Al&shy;though when the stor&shy;ies be&shy;gin Holmes
                        ini&shy;tially needed Wat&shy;son to share the rent for their
                        res&shy;id&shy;ence at 221B Baker Street, by the time of "The Fi&shy;nal
                        Prob&shy;lem", he says that his ser&shy;vices to the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment
                        of France and the roy&shy;al house of Scand&shy;inavia had left him with
                        enough money to re&shy;tire com&shy; fort&shy;ably. The de&shy;tect&shy;ive
                        is known to charge cli&shy;ents for his ex&shy;penses and claim any
                        re&shy;ward offered for a prob&shy;lem's solu&shy;tion;in "The
                        Ad&shy;ven&shy;ture of the Speckled Band" he says that Helen Stoner may
                        pay any ex&shy;penses he in&shy;curs, and asks the bank in "The Red-Headed
                        League" to re&shy;im&shy;burse him for money spent solv&shy;ing the case.
                        Holmes has his wealthy banker cli&shy;ent in"The Ad&shy;ven&shy;ture of the
                        Beryl Cor&shy;on&shy;et" pay the costs of re&shy;cov&shy;er&shy;ing the
                        stolen gems,and claims the re&shy;ward pos&shy;ted for their
                        re&shy;cov&shy;ery. In "The Prob&shy;lem of Thor Bridge" the
                        de&shy;tect&shy;ive says, "My pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al charges are upon
                        a fixed scale. I do not va&shy;rythem, save when I re&shy;mit [omit] them
                        al&shy;to&shy;geth&shy;er". In this con&shy;text a cli&shy;ent is
                        of&shy;fer&shy;ing to double his fee, and it is im&shy;plied that wealthy
                        cli&shy;ents ha&shy;bitu&shy;ally pay Holmes more than his stand&shy;ard
                        fee.

                    <p>
                        The de&shy;tect&shy;ive tells Wat&shy;son, in "A Case of Iden&shy;tity",
                        about a gold snuff box re&shy;ceived from the Kin&shy;gof Bo&shy;hemia
                        after "A Scan&shy;dal in Bo&shy;hemia" and about a valu&shy;able ring
                        giv&shy;en to him by the Dutch roy&shy; al fam&shy;ily; in "The
                        Ad&shy;ven&shy;ture of the Bruce-Part&shy;ing&shy;ton Plans",he re&shy;ceives
                        an em&shy;er&shy;ald tie pin from Queen Vic&shy;tor&shy;ia. In "The
                        Ad&shy;ven&shy;ture of the Pri&shy;or School" Holmes rubs his hands with
                        glee when the Duke of Hol&shy;d&shy;er&shy;nesse men&shy;tions his ₤6,000 fee,
                        the amount of which sur&shy;prises.

                        Holmes oc&shy;ca&shy;sion&shy;ally uses ad&shy;dict&shy;ive drugs,
                        es&shy;pe&shy;cially in the ab&shy;sence of stim&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ing cases.
                        He uses co&shy;caine, which he in&shy;jects in a sev&shy;en-per&shy;cent
                        solu&shy;tion with a syr&shy;inge kept in a Mo&shy;rocco leath&shy;er case.
                        Al&shy;though Holmes also dabbles in morphine, he ex&shy;presses strong
                        dis&shy;ap&shy;prov&shy;al when he vis&shy;its an opi&shy;um den;
                        both drugs were leg&shy;al in late-19th-cen&shy;tury Eng&shy;land. Wat&shy;son
                        and Holmes use to&shy;bacco,smoking ci&shy;gar&shy;ettes,ci&shy;gars, and pipes,
                        and the de&shy;tect&shy;ive is an ex&shy;pert at identi&shy;fy&shy;ing
