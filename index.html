                        But much like her life -- laid bare so honestly in her autobiography
                        "Life As I Know It" -- the fairytale, as she calls it, has been punctuated
                        by massive pitfalls, most recently being replaced as the jockey of last
                        year's winner Prince of Penzance.

                        For the 31-year-old, there have been a lot of highs since that
                        famous win, but for all her effervescent personality -- her
                        "get stuffed" reaction to her victory has gone down in horse
                        racing folklore -- being in the spotlight has not always been
                        a pleasant experience.

                        And she may still get a chance to ride in the "race that stops a nation."
                        Australia's Daily Telegraph recently reported that her run of good of
                        form could see her given a chance on the Sheikh Mohammed bin

                        At times, she finds the interviews hard, pausing for reflection
                        to explain why before saying:

                        Her life to date has been sufficiently captivating for

                        to think about it. I try not to get too involved --
                        although they'll tell me who they've got in mind to play me --
                        and hopefully they do a great job.

                        A clear high of the past year has been to meet her idol,
                        whose first words regarding her Melbourne Cup triumph were
                        simply "well done."

                        I looked up to other people for inspiration," she says.
                        "So if I can inspire people then that makes me happy.
                        "I had one girl come up to me. She must have been 20 or 21,
                        and she told me she was about to drop out of university but
                        that I inspired her to keep going. I love that."
                        While she continues to be an inspiration, there are those in
                        her own family that wish she hadn't returned to the saddle.

                        Her sisters tried to persuade her to call time on her riding career,
                        and at times she was 50-50 whether to return. But that return
                        has been vindicated by her first comeback win in the Coleraine Cup.
                        "The fall was the worst week of my life," she admits. "The pain was
                        just incredible, such a shock. I got trodden on with my horse at
                        full gallop and the pain was so much I had to double up on painkillers.
                        "I ended up hallucinating and then had to have an epidural that
                        didn't work, and there were tubes coming out of everywhere. It
                        was a nightmare. I didn't think poor me, I just wanted to survive
                        and by day three or four I didn't think I could go on."

                    <h3>Experts uncover hidden layers of Jesus' tomb site.</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the innermost chamber of the site said to be the tomb of Jesus,
                        a restoration team has peeled away a marble layer for the first time
                        in centuries in an effort to reach what it believes is the original
                        rock surface where Jesus' body was laid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many historians have long believed that the original cave, identified
                        a few centuries after Jesus' death as his tomb, was obliterated ages ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But an archaeologist accompanying the restoration team said ground penetrating
                        radar tests determined that cave walls are in fact standing — at a height of
                        six feet and connected to bedrock — behind the marbled panels of the chamber
                        at the center of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

                    <p>
                        The work is part of a historic renovation project to reinforce and preserve
                        the Edicule, the chamber housing the cave where Jesus was
                        entombed and resurrected. It is the centerpiece of one of
                        Christianity's oldest churches and one of its most important shrines.

                        A 12th-century building sitting on 4th-century remains,
                        the Church of the Holy Sepluchre is the only place where
                        six Christian denominations practice their faith at the same site.
                        The Edicule was last restored in 1810 following a fire, and is in
                        need of reinforcement after years of exposure to humidity and candle
                        smoke. A hulking iron cage built around the Edicule by British
                        authorities in 1947 for support still stands, but is not enough.
                        Renovations at this holiest of spots require mutual agreement by
                        the church's various custodians, and that is notoriously hard to
                        secure. The denominations jealously guard different parts
                        of the site and often object to even the slightest of changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last year, Israeli police briefly shut down the building after Israel's
                        Antiquities Authority deemed it unsafe. It prompted the Christian
                        denominations to green light the repairs, which began in June.
                        Pilgrims line up throughout the day for the chance to crouch in
                        the Edicule's tiny room. They kneel before a white marble encasing,
                        said to cover a surface hewn from the side of the limestone cave
                        where Jesus' body was laid before his resurrection.
                        Church officials closed the Edicule to pilgrims beginning
                        Wednesday evening, and workers used a pulley to slide open
                        the marble slab, in hopes of reaching the burial surface.
                        Hiebert said the slab hadn't been removed since the year 1550.

                    <p>
                        Michelle Obama continued her criticisms of Donald Trump today in her
                        first joint campaign appearance with Hillary Clinton, but the Republican
                        presidential nominee appears to be unfazed by such attacks.
                        "Look, what is she going to say? Is she going to say I'm fantastic?"
                        Trump asked ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.
                        "Is she going to say, 'Trump is better at that than any
                        other human being in the world,' OK, which I believe I am," he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obama has been one of Clinton's most vocal surrogates in recent weeks,
                        giving a number of well-received speeches on the former secretary of
                        state's behalf but never mentioning Trump by name.
                        But the target of the first lady’s criticism is obvious, including
                        her remarks about the "hurtful, deceitful" birther theory that Trump
                        popularized and his "locker-room talk" defense for a 2005 recording
                        on which he apparently boasts of groping women without their consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "If a candidate is erratic and threatening, if a candidate traffics
                        in prejudice, fear and lies on the campaign trail, if a candidate
                        thinks that not paying taxes makes you smart or that it's good business
                        when people lose their homes, if a candidate regularly and flippantly
                        makes cruel and insulting comments about women -- about how we look,
                        how we act -- well, sadly, that's who that candidate really is,"
                        Obama said in one of her earlier campaign speeches in Pennsylvania.

                        China’s vice minister of environmental protection announced a two-year
                        inspection campaign to root out fake air quality data in April 2015.
                        At the time, the minister accused some local governments of fabricating
                        or tampering with air quality data and told national news agency Xinhua
                        that monitoring stations affiliated with the ministry would help cross
                        check data from other stations.
                        The Chang’an monitoring station was one of the two stations in the city
                        that directly fed data to the CNEMC, according to the local paper’s source.
                        The Chang’an branch of the Xi’an Environmental Protection Bureau has not
                        yet responded to HKFP’s request for comment.
