    <h3>How the wiz&shy;ard&shy;ing world works</h3>
    <h4>WAND CORE</h4>
    <p class="firstParagraph">
        The fol&shy;low&shy;ing de&shy;scrip&shy;tion of the powers and prop&shy;er&shy;ties of 
        the three main wand cores used by Mr Gar&shy;rick Ol&shy;li&shy;vander are taken from his own notes.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Early in my ca&shy;reer, as I watched my wand&shy;maker fath&shy;er wrest&shy;ling with
        sub&shy;stand&shy;ard wand core ma&shy;ter&shy;i&shy;als such as kel&shy;pie hair, I con&shy;ceived
        the am&shy;bi&shy;tion to dis&shy;cov&shy;er the finest cores and to work only with those
        when my time came to take over the fam&shy;ily busi&shy;ness. This I have done. After
        much ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment&shy;a&shy;tion and re&shy;search, I con&shy;cluded that
        only three sub&shy;stances pro&shy;duce wands of the qual&shy;ity to which I am happy to
        give the il&shy;lus&shy;tri&shy;ous name of Ol&shy;li&shy;vander: uni&shy;corn hair, 
        dra&shy;gon heart&shy;string and phoe&shy;nix feath&shy;er. Each of these costly and rare ma&shy;ter
        &shy;i&shy;als has its own dis&shy;tinct prop&shy;er&shy;ties. The fol&shy;low&shy;ing rep
        &shy;res&shy;ents a short sum&shy;mary of my re&shy;searches in&shy;to each of the three 
        Su&shy;preme Cores. Read&shy;ers should bear in mind that each wand is the com&shy;pos
        &shy;ite of its wood, its core and the ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence and natu&shy;re of its own
        &shy;er; that tend&shy;en&shy;cies of each may coun&shy;ter&shy;bal&shy;ance or 
        out&shy;weigh the oth&shy;er; so this can only be a very gen&shy;er&shy;al 
        over&shy;view of an im&shy;mensely com&shy;plex sub&shy;ject.
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Uni&shy;corn</h4>
    <p>
        Uni&shy;corn hair gen&shy;er&shy;ally pro&shy;duces the most con&shy;sist&shy;ent 
        ma&shy;gic, and is least sub&shy;ject to fluc&shy;tu&shy;ations and block&shy;ages. 
        Wands with uni&shy;corn co&shy;res are gen&shy;er&shy;ally the most dif&shy;fi&shy;cult 
        to turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most faith&shy;ful of all wands, and 
        usu&shy;ally re&shy;main stron&shy;gly at&shy;tached to their first own&shy;er, 
        ir&shy;re&shy;spect&shy;ive of wheth&shy;er he or she was an 
        ac&shy;com&shy;plished witch or wiz&shy;ard.
    </p>

    <figcaption>Unicorn</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Minor dis&shy;ad&shy;vant&shy;ages of uni&shy;corn hair are that they do not make the
        most power&shy;ful wands (al&shy;though the wand wood may com&shy;pensate) and that they
        are pro&shy;ne to mel&shy;an&shy;choly if ser&shy;i&shy;ously mis&shy;hand&shy;led, mean&shy;ing 
        that the hair may 'die' and need re&shy;pla&shy;cing.
    </p>
    <h4>Dragon</h4>
    <p>
        As a rule, dragon hear&shy;tstrings pro&shy;duce wands with the most power, and which are
        cap&shy;able of the most flam&shy;boy&shy;ant spells. Dra&shy;gon wands tend to learn more 
        quick&shy;ly than oth&shy;er types. While they can change al&shy;le&shy;gi&shy;ance if won
        from their ori&shy;gin&shy;al mas&shy;ter, they al&shy;ways bond strongly with the 
        cur&shy;rent own&shy;er.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="Dragon.jpg" alt="Dragon">
        <figcaption>Dragon</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The dra&shy;gon wand tends to be easi&shy;est to turn to the Dark Arts, though it will not
        in&shy;cline that way of its own ac&shy;cord. It is also the most prone of the three 
        cores to ac&shy;ci&shy;dents, be&shy;ing some&shy;what tem&shy;pera&shy;ment&shy;al.
    </p>
    <h4>Phoenix</h4>
    <p>
        This is the ra&shy;rest core type. Phoenix feath&shy;ers are cap&shy;able of the grea&shy;test
        range of ma&shy;gic, though they may take lon&shy;ger than either uni&shy;corn or dra&shy;gon cores
        to re&shy;veal this. They show the most ini&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ive, some&shy;times 
        act&shy;ing of their own ac&shy;cord, a qual&shy;ity that many witches and 
        wiz&shy;ards dis&shy;like.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
        Phoe&shy;nix feath&shy;er wands are al&shy;ways the pick&shy;i&shy;est when it comes to 
        po&shy;ten&shy;tial own&shy;ers, for the creature from which they are taken is one of 
        the most in&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ent and de&shy;tached in the world. The&shy;se wands are 
        the hard&shy;est to tame and to per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ise, and their 
        al&shy;le&shy;gi&shy;ance is usu&shy;ally hard won.

    <h3>Mem&shy;bers of The Or&shy;der of the Phoenix</h3>
    <h4>RE&shy;MUS LUPIN</h4>
    <p class="firstParagraph">
    Re&shy;mus Lupin was the only child of the wiz&shy;ard Ly&shy;all Lupin and his 
    Muggle wife Hope How&shy;ell.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ly&shy;all Lupin was a very clev&shy;er, rather shy young man who, by the time he was thirty,
    had be&shy;come a world-renowned au&shy;thor&shy;ity on Non-Hu&shy;man Spir&shy;it&shy;ous 
    Ap&shy;par&shy;i&shy;tions. These in&shy;clude pol&shy;tergeists, Bog&shy;garts and 
    oth&shy;er strange crea&shy;tures that, while some&shy;times ghost&shy;like in 
    ap&shy;pear&shy;ance and be&shy;ha&shy;viour, have nev&shy;er been truly alive and 
    re&shy;main something of a mys&shy;tery even to the wiz&shy;ard&shy;ing world.
    </p>
    <p>
    On an in&shy;vest&shy;ig&shy;at&shy;ive trip in&shy;to a dense Welsh forest in which a 
    par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly vi&shy;cious Bog&shy;gart was sup&shy;posed to be lurk&shy;ing, 
    Ly&shy;all ran across his fu&shy;ture wife. Hope How&shy;ell, a beau&shy;ti&shy;ful 
    Muggle girl who worked in an in&shy;sur&shy;ance of&shy;fice in Cardiff, had taken an 
    ill-ad&shy;vised walk through what she be&shy;lieved to be in&shy;no&shy;cent 
    wood&shy;land. Bog&shy;garts and pol&shy;tergeists may be sensed by Muggles, and Hope, a 
    par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly ima&shy;gin&shy;at&shy;ive and sens&shy;it&shy;ive 
    per&shy;son, had be&shy;come con&shy;vinced that something was watch&shy;ing her from 
    between the dark trees. Even&shy;tu&shy;ally, her ima&shy;gin&shy;a&shy;tion be&shy;came 
    so over&shy;act&shy;ive that the Bog&shy;gart as&shy;sumed a form: that of a large, evil-look
    &shy;ing man, bear&shy;ing down on her with a snarl and out&shy;stretched hands in the gloom. 
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
    Hear&shy;ing her scream, young Ly&shy;all came sprint&shy;ing through the trees, 
    caus&shy;ing the ap&shy;par&shy;i&shy;tion to shrink in&shy;to a field mush&shy;room 
    with one wave of his wand. 
    The ter&shy;ri&shy;fied Hope thought, in her con&shy;fu&shy;sion, 
    that he had driv&shy;en her would-be at&shy;tack&shy;er away, and his first words to her 
    – ‘it’s all right, it was only a Bog&shy;gart’ – made no im&shy;pres&shy;sion on her. 
    No&shy;ti&shy;cing how very beau&shy;ti&shy;ful she was, 
    Ly&shy;all made the wise de&shy;cision not to talk about Bog&shy;garts any more, 
    but in&shy;stead agreed that the man had been very big and scary, 
    and that the only sens&shy;ible thing to do was for him to 
    ac&shy;com&shy;pany Hope home to pro&shy;tect her.
    </p>
    <p>
    The young couple fell in love, and not even Ly&shy;all’s shame&shy;faced ad&shy;mis&shy;sion, 
    some months later, that Hope had nev&shy;er really been in danger, den&shy;ted her 
    en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;asm for him. 
    To Ly&shy;all’s de&shy;light, Hope ac&shy;cep&shy;ted his pro&shy;pos&shy;al 
    of mar&shy;riage and threw her&shy;self en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;ast&shy;ic&shy;ally 
    in&shy;to pre&shy;par&shy;a&shy;tions 
    for the wed&shy;ding, com&shy;plete with a Bog&shy;gart-topped cake.

    <p>
    Ly&shy;all and Hope’s first and only child, Re&shy;mus John, was born after a year of mar&shy;riage. 
    A happy, heal&shy;thy little boy, he showed early signs of ma&shy;gic and both par&shy;ents 
    ima&shy;gined that he would fol&shy;low in his fath&shy;er’s foot&shy;steps, 
    at&shy;tend&shy;ing Hog&shy;warts School of Witch&shy;craft and Wiz&shy;ardry in due course.
