                        LON&shy;DON — Bri&shy;tain’s im&shy;pend&shy;ing exit from the European Uni&shy;on
                        is lead&shy;ing to high&shy;er prices for Apple Mac com&shy;puters here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tech gi&shy;ant un&shy;veiled a new line of Mac&shy;Books on Thursday
                        and used the op&shy;por&shy;tun&shy;ity to an&shy;nounce price hikes for its
                        oth&shy;er, older Apple Mac com&shy;puters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apple Mac buy&shy;ers in the U.K. must hand over 20% more — or
                        up to $610 — start&shy;ing Fri&shy;day. It fol&shy;lows a drop in the
                        pound's value against the dol&shy;lar fol&shy;low&shy;ing the coun&shy;try’s
                        vote to exit the European Uni&shy;on.

                        <q>Apple has to re&shy;cal&shy;ib&shy;rate prices after sig&shy;ni&shy;
                        fic&shy;ant cur&shy;rency fluc&shy;tu&shy;ations, and since the E.U.
                        ref&shy;er&shy;en&shy;dum, U.K. prices are' out of sync with the dol&shy;lar,</q>
                        said Patrick O'Bri&shy;en, an ana&shy;lyst at the Ver&shy;dict Re&shy;tail
                        con&shy;sultancy, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to the BBC.

                    <p>
                        He ad&shy;ded: <q>While price in&shy;creases won't look good to the con&shy;sumer,
                        it's dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to blame Apple.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The price of one Mac Pro desktop rose from $3,048 (&#163;2,499) to
                        $3,658 (&#163;2,999). A 13-inch Mac&shy;Book Air jumped from $1,035 (&#163;849)
                        to $1,157 (&#163;949.)

                    <p>
                        A 12-inch Mac&shy;Book was hiked from $1,279 (&#163;1,049) to $1524 (&#163;1,249.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pound has fallen 18% against the dol&shy;lar since the vote for
                        Brexit at a ref&shy;er&shy;en&shy;dum in June.

                        NEW YORK — While most of the auto in&shy;dustry is fo&shy;cused on get&shy;ting
                        self-driv&shy;ing cars rolling, Uber already has its eyes set to the skies.
                        Lit&shy;er&shy;ally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a white pa&shy;per pub&shy;lished this week, the com&shy;pany de&shy;tailed
                        plans for Uber El&shy;ev&shy;ate, its new di&shy;vi&shy;sion for of&shy;fer&shy;ing
                        rides through fly&shy;ing cars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The com&shy;pany hopes to have the pro&shy;gram up and run&shy;ning with&shy;in
                        a dec&shy;ade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In ad&shy;di&shy;tion to be&shy;ing in&shy;cred&shy;ibly cool, Uber stresses the
                        many be&shy;ne&shy;fits of this meth&shy;od of trans&shy;port&shy;a&shy;tion in
                        this new mode of trans&shy;port&shy;a&shy;tion, time sav&shy;ing be&shy;ing
                        the biggest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>Ima&shy;gine trav&shy;el&shy;ing from San Fran&shy;cisco’s Mar&shy;ina
                        (dis&shy;trict) to work in down&shy;town San Jose — a drive that would
                        nor&shy;mally oc&shy;cupy the bet&shy;ter part of two hours — in only 15 minutes,
                        </q> writes Jeff Hold&shy;en, Uber's chief product of&shy;ficer, and Nikhil
                        Goel, the com&shy;pany's product man&shy;ager for Uber El&shy;ev&shy;ate and
                        ad&shy;vanced pro&shy;grams, in the white pa&shy;per.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <q>What if you could save nearly four hours round-trip between S&#227;o
                        Paulo’s city cen&shy;ter and the sub&shy;urbs in Camp&shy;i&shy;nas? Or ima&shy;gine
                        re&shy;du&shy;cing your 90-plus minute stop-and-go com&shy;mute from Gur&shy;gaon to
                        your of&shy;fice in cent&shy;ral New Del&shy;hi to a mere six minutes,</q>
                        they wrote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plus with more people in the air, the com&shy;pany an&shy;ti&shy;cip&shy;ates it
                        loosen&shy;ing the bur&shy;den on the roads, par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;larly in
                        heav&shy;ily-con&shy;ges&shy;ted areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The com&shy;pany ac&shy;know&shy;ledges that there are chal&shy;lenges for
                        get&shy;ting this project off the ground. As op&shy;posed to us&shy;ing
                        heli&shy;copters, which are ex&shy;pens&shy;ive and noisy, the com&shy;pany
                        will in&shy;stead be re&shy;ly&shy;ing on VTOLs, or &quot;a net&shy;work of small,
                        elec&shy;tric air&shy;craft that take off and land ver&shy;tic&shy;ally.&quot;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The VTOLs are cheap&shy;er and quieter, and their elec&shy;tron&shy;ic basis also
                        mean they will bet&shy;ter for the en&shy;vir&shy;on&shy;ment than the gas-powered
                        heli&shy;copters. Bat&shy;tery tech&shy;no&shy;logy still needs to im&shy;prove,
                        and as these are fly&shy;ing vehicles, the com&shy;pany notes there will need to be
                        some air traffic con&shy;trol mech&shy;an&shy;ism in place. These vehicles also will
                        need prop&shy;erly trained pi&shy;lots at the con&shy;trol, at least un&shy;til they
                        too be&shy;come self-driv&shy;ing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plus there's the eco&shy;nom&shy;ics. This type of fly&shy;ing air&shy;craft, which
                        is already be&shy;ing de&shy;veloped by a vari&shy;ety of com&shy;pan&shy;ies
                        in&shy;clud&shy;ing Joby Avi&shy;ation, Zee.Aero and Air&shy;bus, will be pricey
                        ini&shy;tially, though Uber an&shy;ti&shy;cip&shy;ates that with scale it will
                        drop. For the con&shy;sumer, it sees prices start&shy;ing out high but drop&shy;ping
                        over time thanks to its Uber Pool sys&shy;tem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A 45-mile pool VTOL, for ex&shy;ample, would re&shy;place a 60-mile car ride
                        for po&shy;ten&shy;tially as low as $21. And the trek would only be 15 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The com&shy;pany is plan&shy;ning an El&shy;ev&shy;ate Sum&shy;mit for early next
                        year to fur&shy;ther set the wheels in mo&shy;tion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for tim&shy;ing, the com&shy;pany hopes to have vehicles ready with&shy;in the
                        next five years, with fleets de&shy;ploy&shy;ing over the fol&shy;low&shy;ing five
                        years after that. In the in&shy;ter&shy;im, well, there's al&shy;ways those more
                        tra&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al self-driv&shy;ing Uber cars.
