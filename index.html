                        "Life As I Know It" -- the fairytale, as she calls it, has been punctuated
                        by massive pitfalls, most recently being replaced as the jockey of last

                        famous win, but for all her effervescent personality -- her
                        "get stuffed" reaction to her victory has gone down in horse

                        Australia's Daily Telegraph recently reported that her run of good of

                        At times, she finds the interviews hard, pausing for reflection
                        to explain why before saying:

                        "So if I can inspire people then that makes me happy.

                        and she told me she was about to drop out of university but
                        that I inspired her to keep going. I love that."
                        While she continues to be an inspiration, there are those in

                        has been vindicated by her first comeback win in the Coleraine Cup.
                        "The fall was the worst week of my life," she admits. "The pain was
                        just incredible, such a shock. I got trodden on with my horse at
                        full gallop and the pain was so much I had to double up on painkillers.
                        "I ended up hallucinating and then had to have an epidural that
                        didn't work, and there were tubes coming out of everywhere. It
                        was a nightmare. I didn't think poor me, I just wanted to survive
                        and by day three or four I didn't think I could go on."

                <h3>Experts uncover hidden layers of Jesus' tomb site.</h3>
                <p>
                    In the innermost chamber of the site said to be the tomb of Jesus,
                    a restoration team has peeled away a marble layer for the first time
                    in centuries in an effort to reach what it believes is the original
                    rock surface where Jesus' body was laid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many historians have long believed that the original cave, identified
                    a few centuries after Jesus' death as his tomb, was obliterated ages ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But an archaeologist accompanying the restoration team said ground penetrating
                    radar tests determined that cave walls are in fact standing — at a height of
                    six feet and connected to bedrock — behind the marbled panels of the chamber
                    at the center of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>What was found</q>, said National Geographic archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert,
                    <q>is astonishing</q>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work is part of a historic renovation project to reinforce and preserve
                    the Edicule, the chamber housing the cave where Jesus was
                    entombed and resurrected. It is the centerpiece of one of
                    Christianity's oldest churches and one of its most important shrines.

                    A 12th-century building sitting on 4th-century remains,
                    the Church of the Holy Sepluchre is the only place where
                    six Christian denominations practice their faith at the same site.
                    The Edicule was last restored in 1810 following a fire, and is in
                    need of reinforcement after years of exposure to humidity and candle
                    smoke. A hulking iron cage built around the Edicule by British
                    authorities in 1947 for support still stands, but is not enough.
                    Renovations at this holiest of spots require mutual agreement by
                    the church's various custodians, and that is notoriously hard to
                    secure. The denominations jealously guard different parts
                    of the site and often object to even the slightest of changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last year, Israeli police briefly shut down the building after Israel's
                    Antiquities Authority deemed it unsafe. It prompted the Christian
                    denominations to green light the repairs, which began in June.
                    Pilgrims line up throughout the day for the chance to crouch in
                    the Edicule's tiny room. They kneel before a white marble encasing,
                    said to cover a surface hewn from the side of the limestone cave
                    where Jesus' body was laid before his resurrection.
                    Church officials closed the Edicule to pilgrims beginning
                    Wednesday evening, and workers used a pulley to slide open
                    the marble slab, in hopes of reaching the burial surface.
                    Hiebert said the slab hadn't been removed since the year 1550.

                <h3>Donald Trump Dismisses Michelle Obama's Barbs as Part of 'the Game'</h3>
                <p>
                    Michelle Obama continued her criticisms of Donald Trump today in her
                    first joint campaign appearance with Hillary Clinton, but the Republican
                    presidential nominee appears to be unfazed by such attacks.
                    "Look, what is she going to say? Is she going to say I'm fantastic?"
                    Trump asked ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.
                    "Is she going to say, 'Trump is better at that than any
                    other human being in the world,' OK, which I believe I am," he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obama has been one of Clinton's most vocal surrogates in recent weeks,
                    giving a number of well-received speeches on the former secretary of
                    state's behalf but never mentioning Trump by name.
                    But the target of the first lady’s criticism is obvious, including
                    her remarks about the "hurtful, deceitful" birther theory that Trump
                    popularized and his "locker-room talk" defense for a 2005 recording
                    on which he apparently boasts of groping women without their consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If a candidate is erratic and threatening, if a candidate traffics
                    in prejudice, fear and lies on the campaign trail, if a candidate
                    thinks that not paying taxes makes you smart or that it's good business
                    when people lose their homes, if a candidate regularly and flippantly
                    makes cruel and insulting comments about women -- about how we look,
                    how we act -- well, sadly, that's who that candidate really is,"
                    Obama said in one of her earlier campaign speeches in Pennsylvania.

                    Three Xi’an officials have been detained by police after it was
                    found that an air quality monitoring station sampling unit in Central
                    China had been stuffed with cotton material in an effort to cheat
                    the sensors.

                    An official at the Chang’an branch of the Xi’an Environmental
                    Protection Bureau reportedly made a copy of the key to the
                    monitoring station and memorised the passcode to the restricted
                    area, reported Xi’an newspaper Huashangbao. Staff then repeatedly
                    snuck into the station to stuff cotton into the sampling unit.

                <p>
                    Air quality monitors typically draw in air then measure the
                    amount of particles present. A source familiar with the matter
                    told the newspaper that stuffing cotton material into the
                    sampling unit would act as an air filter.

                    The China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC), which
                    is overseen by the Ministry of Environmental Protection, noticed the
                    change in the data. Following an investigation by the police, those
                    suspected to be involved were detained by police, reported The Paper.

                    China’s vice minister of environmental protection announced a two-year
                    inspection campaign to root out fake air quality data in April 2015.
                    At the time, the minister accused some local governments of fabricating
                    or tampering with air quality data and told national news agency Xinhua
                    that monitoring stations affiliated with the ministry would help cross
                    check data from other stations.
                    The Chang’an monitoring station was one of the two stations in the city
                    that directly fed data to the CNEMC, according to the local paper’s source.
