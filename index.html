            <h3>John Wick co-director reportedly wanted for Deadpool 2</h3>
            <p>Following the surprise news earlier this week that
                Tim Miller has vacated the director’s chair on Deadpool 2,
                it seems that 20th Century Fox is wasting little time in securing a replacement.</p>

            </div>
            <p>According to Mashable, the studio is keen on John Wick co-director David Leitch,
                although apparently several other directors remain in the mix, and a formal offer
                is yet to be made.</p>
            <p>Leitch does have previous experience with Fox, star Reynold Reynolds
                and Deadpool, having served as stunt coordinator on X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He’s also
                performed stunts on previous Marvel movies Blade and Daredevil, as we;; as directing
                second unit on The Wolverine and Captain America: Civil War.</p>

                'Doctor Strange' Opens with &#36;86M Overseas</h3>
            <p>Sony's Inferno experienced an opening weekend meltdown as the third film in the Robert Langdon
