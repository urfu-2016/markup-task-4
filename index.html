                <h3>Donald Trump Allies Focus Anger on Another Target: G.O.P. Leaders.</h3>
                <p>Faced with the demoralizing prospect of a third consecutive loss
                    in a presidential race, conservative Republicans are girding
                    for an extended clash on two fr&shy;onts in the months ahead:
                    one with a Hillary Clinton admin&shy;istra&shy;tion that could
                    look like a reprise of the pa&shy;rtisan battles of the 1990s,
                    and another with Republican leaders on Capitol Hill who reject&shy;ed
                    Donald J. Trump.</p>
                <p>Though a victory by Mrs. Clin&shy;ton is far from a foregone conclusion,
                    what does seem clear is that the frust&shy;rations and an&shy;xieties
                    that fueled Mr. Trump’s rise will not be fleeting. And a defeat
                    of Mr. Trump — which he has al&shy;ready darkly allud&shy;ed
                    to as part of a plot to disenfranchise his supporters — could
                    fur&shy;ther inflame those on the right whose goal all along
                    has been to disrupt the country’s political system.</p>
                <p>Some of the loudest voices on the right seem poised to channel that
                    anger into one of their favorite and most frequent pursuits:
                    eating their own.</p>
                <p>Some in the deeply factionalized Republican Party, including Mr.
                    Trump and some of his senior aides, are already fanning the flames
                    for a revolt against the Hou&shy;se speaker, Representative Paul
                    D. Ryan of Wisconsin, once Congress reconvenes after the election.
                    Mr. Trump, who has lashed out at the speaker for being critical
                    of him, has privately said that Mr. Ryan should pay a price for
                    his disloyalty, according to two people close to Mr. Trump who
                    insisted on anonymity to describe internal campaign discussions.</p>
                <p>Mr. Trump made his frustrations plain on Tuesday.
                    <q>The people are very angry with the leadership of this party,
                        because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent,
                        if we had support from the top,</q> he said in an interview
                    with Reuters. (He hastened to add:
                    <q>I think we’re going to win it anyway.</q>)</p>

                <h3>Healthy Job Growth in Last Snapshot Before Election</h3>
                <p>The last time the unemployment rate was running this low was in early
                    2008. But by Election Day that year, the economy was in sad shape
                    and getting worse by every measure. Hundreds of thousands of
                    jobs were vanishing, housing prices were plunging, paychecks
                    were shrinking and credit was tight.</p>
                <p>
                    <q>The economy set three postrecession records this month,</q> said
                    Jed Kolko, chief economist at the online jobs website Indeed,
                    citing solid wage growth, a drop in the number of discouraged
                    and underemployed workers, and a return of prime-age men and
                    women to the labor force.
                    <q>These are all signs that the labor market continues to strengthen
                        and is at its strongest point since the crisis,</q> he said.</p>
                <p>How Economic Data Is Kept Politics-Free NOV. 3, 2016</p>
                <p>Fed Signals It’s on Track to Raise Interest Rates in December NOV.
                    2, 201</p>
                <p>While the presidential candidates have lately been talking about
                    almost everything but the economy, the new Labor Department report
                    refocused attention — at least briefly — on the crucial bread-and-butter
                    issue: jobs.</p>
                <p>All the upbeat assessments from economists on the right and left,
                    though, were strikingly at odds with the gloomy portrait frequently
                    drawn at election rallies.</p>
                <p>Donald J. Trump, who was propelled to the top of the Republican ticket
                    in part by nagging economic anxiety and voter anger among the
                    white working class, doubled down on the negatives on Friday.
                    At a rally in New Hampshire, Mr. Trump labeled the latest jobs
                    report
                    <q>an absolute disaster,</q> and said
                    <q>nobody believes the numbers anyway.</q>
                </p>
                <p>Hillary Clinton has emphasized President Obama’s success in digging
                    the country out of the recession, pointing to 73 consecutive
                    months of job growth in the private sector.
                    <q>We got some good news this morning,</q> she said on Friday at
                    Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.
                    <q>I believe that our economy is poised to really take off and thrive.</q>
                </p>
                <p>Yet Mrs. Clinton, too, acknowledges wide pockets of economic discontent.
                    <q>We need to make sure the economy is working for everyone,</q>
                    she added,
                    <q>not just those at the top.</q>
                </p>
                <p>Those repeated economic dirges have stuck in many voters’ minds,
                    echoing like a jingle you can’t get out of your head.</p>

                <h3>Police Sergeant Fatally Shot in the Bronx; Another Is Injured</h3>
                <p>The police found the suspect just a few blocks from the Bronx apartment
                    he had stormed into on Friday, armed with a gun and looking for
                    his estranged wife.</p>
                <p>One sergeant approached the red Jeep that dispatchers had told the
                    officers to look for. He was shot in the face. Another sergeant
                    was shot in the leg.</p>
                <p>“Officer down! Officer down!” a police officer on the scene radioed
                    to the dispatcher.</p>
                <p>The sergeant who was shot in the face, Paul Tuozzolo, died at Jacobi
                    Medical Center within hours of the shooting. The other sergeant,
                    Emmanuel Kwo, was in stable condition at the same hospital.</p>
                <p>Sgt. Paul Tuozzolo Credit New York City Police Department</p>
                <p>The suspect, identified as Manuel Rosales, 35, of Long Island, was
                    killed during the exchange of gunfire, which unfolded in the
                    middle of the afternoon, not far from the southern edge of the
                    Bronx Zoo.</p>
                <p>In an interview, the father of Mr. Rosales said his son was deeply
                    troubled. He had spoken of committing “suicide by cop,” had received
                    a diagnosis of bipolar disorder as a teenager and had a volatile
                    relationship with his estranged wife, the father, also Manuel
                    Rosales, said.</p>
                <p>The death of Sergeant Tuozzolo was the first line-of-duty killing
                    of a police officer in New York City since October 2015, when
                    Officer Randolph Holder was shot in the head in East Harlem.</p>

                <h3>Clinton Lands an Opening Act: Jay Z and Beyoncé.</h3>
                <p>CLEVELAND — In an election year when Hillary Clinton is depending
                    on young black voters to turn out, she may have gotten her biggest
                    boost yet here on Friday.</p>
                <p>Some of the most famous names in hip-hop came out to rally votes
                    for her at an event that featured Beyoncé, Jay Z and Chance the
                    Rapper, all of whom implored thousands of cheering people to
                    back the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>
                <p>“Hello, Cleveland!” Mrs. Clinton said as she stood onstage with Beyoncé
                    and Jay Z.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Clinton called Beyoncé “a woman who is an inspiration to so
                    many others” and thanked Jay Z “for addressing in his music some
                    of our biggest challenges in the country: poverty, racism, the
                    urgent need for criminal justice reform.”</p>
                <p>“When I see them here, this passion and energy and intensity, I don’t
                    even know where to begin because this is what America is, my
                    friends,” she said.</p>
                <p>At the concert, aimed largely at urging black voters and millennials
                    to vote on Tuesday, some of the biggest stars emphasized the
                    historical significance of potentially electing the first woman
                    as president.</p>
                <p>The reasons were apparent. While black voters catapulted Mrs. Clinton
                    to victory in the primary contest against Senator Bernie Sanders
                    of Vermont, black turnout is down from 2012 in several states
                    and young black voters have proved somewhat resistant to supporting
                    Mrs. Clinton in the general election.</p>
                <p>Yet the challenges facing Mrs. Clinton were clearly on display on
                    Friday. When she took the stage and began making the case for
                    her candidacy, dozens of people began leaving the arena, the
                    performance now over.</p>

                <h1>ISIS Sent Four Car Bombs.  The Last One Hit Me.</h1>
                <p>Mr. Denton, a photographer for The New York Times, was with Iraqi
                    counterterrorism forces as they began pushing toward Mosul last
                    week. BARTELLA, Iraq — Our convoy had already been targeted by
                    suicide car bombs three times, over a long day spent under fire.
                    So the Iraqi forces had brought up a tank, and its main gun kept
                    scanning the road ahead toward Mosul. But the shouts started
                    coming from behind us instead, and when I turned to look, I knew
                    right away: Here was bomb No. 4, seemingly out of nowhere. By
                    the time I saw it, the vehicle was maybe 70 feet away.
                </p>
                <p>We were with a unit of elite Iraqi counterterrorism forces, who on
                    Thursday morning were making their first moves in the broader
                    battle to take Mosul back from the Islamic State. The commandos’
                    first big objective was to surround and clear Bartella, a militant-held
                    town about six miles east of the outer fringes of Mosul. Starting
                    out from an Iraqi base around 5 a.m., the troops began pushing
                    east along the main highway that links the Kurdish regional capital,
                    Erbil, with Mosul.
                </p>
                <p>Under peaceful circumstances, that drive would take maybe an hour
                    and a half. But it would take the unit we were with nearly all
                    day just to push three miles into Islamic State territory to
                    the western edge of Bartella, where the troops were to cut off
                    the Islamic State fighters holed up in the town, keeping them
                    from escaping to Mosul or being reinforced from there. There
                    were bombs all along the road, and nearly every village along
                    the way would be a source of attack.An Iraqi reporter for The
                    Times and I were traveling with a television crew from the British
                    news service ITN. We climbed up into a huge Iraqi Army MRAP —
                    a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle — in the middle of
                    a large convoy of vehicles preparing to leave for Bartella.</p>
                <p>
                    As we set out, though, the crew was told that our vehicle would be leading the way,
                    transporting the ordnance disposal experts who would be working
                    to clear the convoy’s routes through the fields and villages
                    south of the highway.I was nervous, but there was no time to
                    stop and figure out how to shift to vehicles behind us. We hadn’t
                    gone far, but we were already taking fire from different directions.</p>
