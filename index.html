            <h1>Placebo sweet spot for pain relief identified in brain</h1>
            <div class="caption">
                Scientists have identified for the first time the region in the brain
                responsible for the "placebo effect" in pain relief, when a fake treatment
                actually results in substantial reduction of pain, according to new research
                from Northwestern Medicine and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC).

                    Sci&shy;ent&shy;ists have iden&shy;ti&shy;fied for the first time the re&shy;gion
                    in the brain re&shy;spons&shy;ible for the "placebo ef&shy;fect" in pain
                    re&shy;lief, when a fake treat&shy;ment ac&shy;tu&shy;ally res&shy;ults in

                    Pin&shy;point&shy;ing the sweet spot of the pain killing placebo ef&shy;fect
                    could res&shy;ult in the design of more per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ized medi&shy;cine
                    for the 100 mil&shy;lion Amer&shy;ic&shy;ans with chron&shy;ic pain. The fMRI

                    to ush&shy;er in an era of in&shy;di&shy;vidu&shy;al&shy;ized pain ther&shy;apy
                    by en&shy;abling tar&shy;geted pain med&shy;ic&shy;a&shy;tion based on how an
                    in&shy;di&shy;vidu&shy;al's brain re&shy;sponds to a drug.

                    <q>The new tech&shy;no&shy;logy will al&shy;low phys&shy;i&shy;cians to see what

                    Ap&shy;kari&shy;an said. <q>It also will provide more evid&shy;ence-based
                    meas&shy;ure&shy;ments. Phys&shy;i&shy;cians will be able to meas&shy;ure how

                    Sci&shy;ent&shy;ists showed placebo pill in&shy;ges&shy;tion is as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ated
                    with a strong an&shy;al&shy;gesia ef&shy;fect, with more than half of the pa&shy;tients

                    op&shy;tion for in&shy;di&shy;vidu&shy;al pa&shy;tients, it would

                    data and identi&shy;fy&shy;ing pat&shy;terns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a long held the&shy;ory that the sub&shy;con&shy;scious mind
                    can re&shy;cog&shy;nise pat&shy;terns with&shy;in com&shy;plex data and
                    that we are hard&shy;wired to find simple pat&shy;terns pleas&shy;ur&shy;able.
                    Dr Nich&shy;olas Hud&shy;son used 'lossless' mu&shy;sic com&shy;pres&shy;sion
                    pro&shy;grams to mim&shy;ic the brain's abil&shy;ity to con&shy;dense au&shy;dio
                    in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion. He com&shy;pared the amount of
                    com&shy;press&shy;ib&shy;il&shy;ity of ran&shy;dom noise to a wide range of
                    mu&shy;sic in&shy;clud&shy;ing clas&shy;sic&shy;al, techno, rock, and pop, and
                    found that, while ran&shy;dom noise could only be com&shy;pressed to 86% of its
                    ori&shy;gin&shy;al file size, and techno, rock, and pop to about 60%, the

                <p>
                    Dr Nich&shy;olas Hud&shy;son says <q>En&shy;dur&shy;ing mu&shy;sic&shy;al

                    com&shy;press&shy;ib&shy;il&shy;ity that we re&shy;spond to. So wheth&shy;er
                    you are a die hard clas&shy;si&shy;cist or a pop diva it seems that we chose
                    the mu&shy;sic we prefer, not by simply listen&shy;ing to it, but by
                    cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing its com&shy;press&shy;ib&shy;il&shy;ity.

                    which sounds com&shy;plex but that, in terms of its data, is re&shy;du&shy;cible
