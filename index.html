                            A&nbsp;controversial new study by&nbsp;scientists at&nbsp;the
                            International Center
                            for Alternative Scientific Theory (ICAST) suggests that cholesterol
                            may hold the key to&nbsp;curing cancer. The report released yesterday
                            sent shockwaves through the medical community. &laquo;Simply put,
                            the results
                            of&nbsp;our preliminary research are stunning and completely
                            unexpected.&raquo; said Dr.
                            Leigh Quindara. leader of&nbsp;the study, in&nbsp;an
                            &nbsp;exclusive interview with USA TODAY.
                            The experimental protocol, according to&nbsp;
                            Quindara and researcher Steve Pearson.
                            involved two groups of&nbsp;rats. The control group was given
                            a&nbsp;normal healthy diet.
                            while the experimental group was given eggs and bacon
                            cooked in&nbsp;lard and smothered
                            in&nbsp;Hollandaise sauce. At&nbsp;the same time,
                            both groups were forced to&nbsp;breathe
                            polluted air laden with carcinogens that was
                            the equivalent of&nbsp;smoking three packs
                            of&nbsp;cigarettes per day.
                            After 7&nbsp;months. the control group rats all had
                            lung tumors, while the experimental
                            group did not. The cholesterol levels in&nbsp;
                            the experimental group were 400%
                            greater than the control group, &laquo;
                            I&nbsp;t&rsquo;s too soon to&nbsp;determine
                            if&nbsp;the cholesterol was a&nbsp;preventative
                            or&nbsp;a&nbsp;cure,&raquo; said Dr. Stephanie Winter.

                            yesterday morning when Ruby Lee Dontanovich of&nbsp;South Hill Valley
                            decided to&nbsp;rehydrate two pineapple-pepperoni pizza slices that
                            she had hydrated the night before. &laquo;My&nbsp;four kids were all
                            screaming for pizza for breakfast, but we&nbsp;only
                            had two slices left over from dinner. So.
                            I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;double the portions by
                            rehydrating them? Reydrating food can
                            cause an&nbsp;abnormal buildup of

                            an&nbsp;explosion can result.
                            The hydrator was in&nbsp;an&nbsp;inappropriate location,
                            and the door was apparently forced shut to&nbsp;override the

                            &quot;The entire unit blew apart,
                            and Dontanovich and two of&nbsp;her children were

                        A&nbsp;Match Made in&nbsp;Spate, USA TODAY has learned.
                        Zemeckis, a&nbsp;long-time fan
                        of&nbsp;McFly&rsquo;s first novel, has long dreamed
                        of&nbsp;directing a&nbsp;film version of
                        the best seller, and has been maneuvering
                        to&nbsp;secure the film rights
                        for years.. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;exclusive interview with USA TODAY,
                        Zemecki&bull; disclosed he&nbsp;had originally campaigned
                        to&nbsp;direct the project as&nbsp;soon as
                        he&nbsp;read the novel. &quot;At&nbsp;the time,
                        I&nbsp;thought A&nbsp;Match Made in&nbsp;Space was
                        the best science fiction novel of&nbsp;the decade, and
                        its stature has only increased over t&nbsp;he&nbsp;years.
                        I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;meetings back in&nbsp;the day,
                        only to&nbsp;be&nbsp;told that no&nbsp;one thought&nbsp;I
                        could handle a&nbsp;film with
                        a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;special effects.:&rsquo; says the
                        director. whose latest
                        production. The Walk is&nbsp;currently prnering rave
                        reviews from critics and audiences alike. Zemeckis&rsquo;
                        perseverance in&nbsp;his
                        pursuit to&nbsp;direct his dream project stems
