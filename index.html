            The Queen has un&shy;veiled the latest statue to grace the grounds of the&nbsp;
            Prince&nbsp;of&nbsp;Wales’s&nbsp;Pound&shy;bury es&shy;tate: a&nbsp;bronze of the late Queen
            Eliza&shy;beth the Queen&nbsp;Moth&shy;er.
        </p>
        <p>
            She was joined by the Duke&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ed&shy;in&shy;burgh, Prince&nbsp;Charles and the
            Duch&shy;ess of Corn&shy;wall as they took a tour of the newly com&shy;pleted
            Queen&nbsp;Moth&shy;er&nbsp;Square.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prince&nbsp;Charles, whose grand&shy;moth&shy;er died aged 101 in 2002, told the crowd
            who had gathered for the un&shy;veil&shy;ing of the 10ft statue, right: <blockquote>It is
            with im&shy;mense pride and in lov&shy;ing memory of my darling grand&shy;moth&shy;er
            that I&nbsp;open her square.</blockquote> He ad&shy;ded: <blockquote>For me one of the most
            es&shy;sen&shy;tial fea&shy;tures of Pound&shy;bury has been its mixed use and mixed in&shy;come
            com&shy;pos&shy;i&shy;tion — a dan&shy;ger&shy;ously re&shy;volu&shy;tion&shy;ary

            He also ac&shy;know&shy;ledged that his ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;tur&shy;al views
            had been out of fa&shy;vour, de&shy;scrib&shy;ing how he had been

            <blockquote>Bat&shy;tling against the tide is an un&shy;com&shy;fort&shy;able

            Prince&nbsp;Charles went on to thank the build&shy;ing com&shy;pan&shy;ies
            in&shy;volved without whose work <em>none of this would ever have been achieved
            to such a high stand&shy;ard of qual&shy;ity</em> and their loc&shy;al
            crafts&shy;men, whom he called <em>Dor&shy;set men through and through</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Work began on the project in 1993 with the idea to cre&shy;ate an
            urb&shy;an quarter of Dorchester that would give pri&shy;or&shy;ity to people,
            rather than cars, and where com&shy;mer&shy;cial build&shy;ings were mixed with
            res&shy;id&shy;en&shy;tial areas, shops and leis&shy;ure fa&shy;cil&shy;it&shy;ies
            to cre&shy;ate a walk&shy;able com&shy;munity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pound&shy;bury is home to 3,000 people in a mix of private and af&shy;ford&shy;able
            hous&shy;ing. The es&shy;tate also provides jobs for 2,100 people and is
            home to 185 busi&shy;nesses.

            An&shy;drew Hamilton, de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment dir&shy;ect&shy;or for the
            Duchy of Corn&shy;wall, told Prince Charles:</p>
            <blockquote>
                You, sir, single-handedly set out to chal&shy;lenge the ac&shy;cep&shy;ted
                or&shy;tho&shy;doxy of plan&shy;ning and de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment in this
                coun&shy;try. At a time when there is a clam&shy;our for new hous&shy;ing I
                be&shy;lieve that Pound&shy;bury stands as a beacon to the way for&shy;ward.
