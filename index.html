                            A controversial new study by scientists at the
                            International
                            Center
                            for Alternative Scientific Theory (ICAST) suggests that cholesterol
                            may hold the key to curing cancer. The report released yesterday
                            sent shockwaves through the medical community. "Simply put, the results
                            of our preliminary research are stunning and completely unexpected." said Dr.
                            Leigh Quindara. leader of the study, in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY.
                            The experimental protocol, according to Quindara and researcher Steve Pearson.
                            involved two groups of rats. The control group was given a normal healthy diet.
                            while the experimental group was given eggs and bacon cooked in lard and
                            smothered
                            in Hollandaise sauce. At the same time, both groups were forced to breathe
                            polluted air laden with carcinogens that was
                            the equivalent of smoking three packs of cigarettes per day.
                            After 7 months. the control group rats all had lung tumors, while the
                            experimental
                            group did not. The cholesterol levels in the experimental group were 400%
                            greater than the control group, "I t's too soon to determine
                            if the cholesterol was a preventative or a cure," said Dr. Stephanie Winter.

                            yesterday morning when Ruby Lee Dontanovich of South Hill Valley
                            decided to rehydrate two pineapple-pepperoni pizza slices that
                            she had hydrated the night before. "My four kids were all
                            screaming for pizza for breakfast, but we only

                            rehydrating them? Reydrating food can cause an abnormal buildup of
                            water pressure within the hydrator, and if the device is
                            clogged or improperly vented, an explosion can result.
                            The hydrator was in an inappropriate location, and the door
                            was apparently forced shut to override the safety mechanism," said
                            Hill Valley Police Detective. Dana Mitchell. who is a
                            police expert in hydration accidents. "The entire unit blew apart,
                            and Dontanovich and two of her children were hit by flying debris from
                            the exploding device, similar to shrapnel.

                        A Match Made in Spate, USA TODAY has learned. Zemeckis, a long-time fan
                        of McFly's first novel, has long dreamed of directing a film version of
                        the best seller, and has been maneuvering to secure the film rights
                        for years.. In an exclusive interview with USA TODAY, Zemecki•
                        disclosed he had originally campaigned to direct the project as soon as
                        he read the novel. "At the time, I thought A Match Made in Space was
                        the best science fiction novel of the decade, and its stature has only
                        increased over t he years. I had a lot of meetings back in the day,
                        only to be told that no one thought I could handle a film with
                        a lot of special effects.:' says the director. whose latest
                        production. The Walk is currently prnering rave reviews from
                        critics and audiences alike. Zemeckis' perseverance in his
                        pursuit to direct his dream project stems from his own personal philosophy.
