                            BAR&shy;TELLA, Ir&shy;aq — Our con&shy;voy
                            had already been tar&shy;geted by sui&shy;cide
                            car bombs three times, over a long day spent
                            un&shy;der fire. So the Ir&shy;aqi forces had
                            brought up a tank, and its main gun kept
                            scan&shy;ning the road ahead to&shy;ward
                            Mo&shy;sul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the shouts star&shy;ted com&shy;ing
                            from be&shy;hind us in&shy;stead, and when
                            I turned to look, I knew right away: Here
                            was Bomb No. 4, seem&shy;ingly out of nowhere.
                            By the time I saw it, the vehicle was maybe
                            70 feet away.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            We were with a unit of elite Ir&shy;aqi
                            coun&shy;terter&shy;ror&shy;ism forces, who
                            on the morn&shy;ing of Oct. 20 were mak&shy;ing
                            their first moves in the broad&shy;er battle
                            to take Mo&shy;sul back from the
                            Is&shy;lam&shy;ic State.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The com&shy;mandos’ first big
                            ob&shy;ject&shy;ive was to sur&shy;round and
                            clear Bar&shy;tella, a mil&shy;it&shy;ant-held
                            town about six miles east of the out&shy;er
                            fringes of Mo&shy;sul. Start&shy;ing out from
                            an Ir&shy;aqi base around 5 a.m., the troops
                            began push&shy;ing east along the main
                            high&shy;way that links the Kur&shy;d&shy;ish
                            re&shy;gion&shy;al cap&shy;it&shy;al, Er&shy;bil,
                            with Mo&shy;sul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Un&shy;der peace&shy;ful cir&shy;cum&shy;stances,
                            that drive would take maybe an hour and a half.
                            But it would take the unit we were with nearly
                            all day just to push three miles in&shy;to
                            Is&shy;lam&shy;ic State ter&shy;rit&shy;ory to
                            the west&shy;ern edge of Bar&shy;tella, where
                            the troops were to cut off the Is&shy;lam&shy;ic
                            State fight&shy;ers holed up in the town,
                            keep&shy;ing them from es&shy;cap&shy;ing to
                            Mo&shy;sul or be&shy;ing re&shy;in&shy;forced
                            from there. There were bombs all along the road,
                            and nearly every vil&shy;lage along the way would
                            be a...

                                People love to in&shy;vade Malta.
                                The Medi&shy;ter&shy;ranean is&shy;land
                                na&shy;tion, situ&shy;ated between
                                Si&shy;cily and Tunisia, counts among its
                                un&shy;wel&shy;come guests the Ro&shy;mans,
                                the Ot&shy;to&shy;mans, Na&shy;po&shy;leon and,
                                in the early 20th cen&shy;tury, hun&shy;dreds of
                                Rus&shy;si&shy;an ar&shy;is&shy;to&shy;crats
                                flee&shy;ing the fall of the czar&shy;ist
                                auto&shy;cracy. For the most part, the Maltese
                                were hav&shy;ing none of this. Na&shy;po&shy;leon
                                was forced out after just two years, and the
                                Knights of Malta — ef&shy;fect&shy;ively, and
                                against all odds — de&shy;feated the Ot&shy;to&shy;man
                                Em&shy;pire’s much lar&shy;ger forces. In Val&shy;letta,
                                Malta’s cap&shy;it&shy;al, people still bring up the
                                Great Siege with enorm&shy;ous pride, boast&shy;ing
                                about it as if they had ac&shy;tu&shy;ally been there.

                                For all of Val&shy;letta’s in&shy;terest in the past —
                                the city is a Un&shy;esco World Her&shy;it&shy;age Site,
                                and the 16th-cen&shy;tury Saint John’s Co-Cathed&shy;ral

                                with an ap&shy;peal that is both his&shy;tor&shy;ic and
                                mod&shy;ern. The area’s Baroque ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;ture
                                now houses boutique ho&shy;tels in&shy;stead of knights in
                                ar&shy;mor, while none oth&shy;er than Renzo Pi&shy;ano has

                                mov&shy;ing in&shy;doors as well, with sev&shy;er&shy;al
                                am&shy;bi&shy;tious gal&shy;ler&shy;ies on the ho&shy;ri&shy;zon,

                                Val&shy;letta, like the rest of Malta, is a pas&shy;tiche of
                                his&shy;tor&shy;ic&shy;al in&shy;flu&shy;ences. Its lan&shy;guage
                                has un&shy;der&shy;tones ran&shy;ging from Ar&shy;ab&shy;ic to
                                Itali&shy;an, among a vari&shy;ety of oth&shy;er dia&shy;lects.
                                The same is true of the food, a unique mix of
                                Medi&shy;ter&shy;ranean and North Afric&shy;an
                                in&shy;flu&shy;ences — which, as it turns out, is one
                                of the more pos&shy;it&shy;ive res&shy;ults of all those
                                in&shy;va&shy;sions.
