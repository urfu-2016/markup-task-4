                        A group of sci&shy;entists is launching what they say will
                        be a new paci&shy;fist nation-state in space.

                        Asgardia &laquo;will become a place in orbit which is truly
                        'no man's land',&raquo; its website says. The new &laquo;nation&raquo;
                        aims to launch its first sa&shy;tellite late next year and
                        hopes to one day be recog&shy;nised by the UN. But some experts have cast
                        doubt on the viabi&shy;lity of the plan, given inter&shy;national
                        law prohi&shy;bits national sove&shy;reignty claims in outer space.

                        In essence, an object sit&shy;ting in a &laquo;quiet&raquo; region of space can be
                        held there if it is sur&shy;rounded by very high-intensity sound waves. As the
                        pat&shy;tern of that boun&shy;dary shifts, the object can be moved around.

                    Given Asgardia will not be asso&shy;ciated with a self-gover&shy;ning terri&shy;tory,
                    with its 'citizens' rema&shy;ining on earth, its pros&shy;pects for

                    The project is being funded per&shy;sonally by Dr Ashur&shy;beiyli at present,

                    more than 50,000 people have applied to 'join' the state online.
