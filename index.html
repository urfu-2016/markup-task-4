                <h1>'So Close, Yet So Far,' Sighs Cape</h1>
                <h2>U.S. Had Hoped For Own Launch</h2>
                <p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla (AP) - The Redstone rocket which the United States
                    had hoped would boost the first man into space stands on a launching pad here.
                    The Soviet Union beat its firing date by at least two weeks.</p>
                <p>"So close, yet so far," commented a technician who is helping groom the Redstone
                    to send one of America's astronauts on a short suborbital flight, hopefully late
                    this month or early in May.</p>
                <p>"If we hadn't had those troubles last fall and on the chimp and Little Joe shots
                    this year, we might have made it," the technician said.</p>
                <p>"But you have to give the Russian seientists credit. They've accomplished a
                    remarkable breakthrough."</p>

                <h1>Soviet Officer Orbits Globe In 5-Ton Ship</h1>
                <h2>Maximum Height Reached Reported As 188 Miles</h2>
                <p>MOSCOW (AP) - A Soviet astronaut has orbited the globe for more than an hour
                    and returned safely to receive the plaudits of seientists and political leaders alike.
                    Soviet announcement of the feat brought praise from President Kennedy and U.S. space
                    experts left behind in the contest to put the first man into successful space flight.</p>
                <p>By the Soviet account, Maj. Yuri Alekseyvich Gargarin, rode a five-ton spaceship once
                    around the earth in an orbit taking an hour and 20 minutes. He was in the air
                    a total of an hour and 48 minutes.</p>
                <p>The whole sequence of events and the announcements relating to it reaised a number of
                    questions. The Soviet announcement said the flight took place today between 9:07 and
                    10:55 a.m., but some persons in Moscow's Western colony were skeptical that the feat
                    actually came off today.</p>
