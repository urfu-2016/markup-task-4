            <h1>Placebo sweet spot for pain relief identified in brain</h1>
            <div class="caption">
                    Scientists have identified for the first time the region in&nbsp;the brain
                    responsible for the &laquo;placebo effect&raquo; in&nbsp;pain relief, 
                    when a&nbsp;fake treatment actually results in&nbsp;substantial reduction 
                    of&nbsp;pain, according to&nbsp;new research from Northwestern Medicine 
                    and the Rehabilitation Institute of&nbsp;Chicago (RIC).

                    Sci&shy;ent&shy;ists have iden&shy;ti&shy;fied for the first time the re&shy;gion
                    in the brain re&shy;spons&shy;ible for the "placebo ef&shy;fect" in pain
                    re&shy;lief, when a fake treat&shy;ment ac&shy;tu&shy;ally res&shy;ults in
                    sub&shy;stan&shy;tial re&shy;duc&shy;tion of pain, ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to new
                    re&shy;search from North&shy;west&shy;ern Medi&shy;cine and the
                    Re&shy;hab&shy;il&shy;it&shy;a&shy;tion In&shy;sti&shy;tute of Chica&shy;go (RIC).

                    Pin&shy;point&shy;ing the sweet spot of the pain killing placebo ef&shy;fect
                    could res&shy;ult in the design of more per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ized medi&shy;cine
                    for the 100 mil&shy;lion Amer&shy;ic&shy;ans with chron&shy;ic pain. The fMRI
                    tech&shy;no&shy;logy de&shy;veloped for the study has the po&shy;ten&shy;tial
                    to ush&shy;er in an era of in&shy;di&shy;vidu&shy;al&shy;ized pain ther&shy;apy
                    by en&shy;abling tar&shy;geted pain med&shy;ic&shy;a&shy;tion based on how an
                    in&shy;di&shy;vidu&shy;al's brain re&shy;sponds to a drug.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The find&shy;ing also will lead to more pre&shy;cise and ac&shy;cur&shy;ate
                    clin&shy;ic&shy;al tri&shy;als for pain med&shy;ic&shy;a&shy;tions by

                </p>
                <p>
                    The sci&shy;ent&shy;ists dis&shy;covered a unique brain re&shy;gion with&shy;in
                    the mid front&shy;al gyr&shy;us that iden&shy;ti&shy;fies placebo pill
                    re&shy;spon&shy;ders in one tri&shy;al and can be val&shy;id&shy;ated (95 per&shy;cent
                    cor&shy;rect) in the placebo group of a second tri&shy;al.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The study was pub&shy;lished Oct. 27, 2016, in PLOS Bio&shy;logy.

                    pain pop&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion could both help the design of per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ized
                    medi&shy;cine and en&shy;hance the suc&shy;cess of clin&shy;ic&shy;al tri&shy;als,</q>
                    said Mar&shy;wan Ba&shy;liki, re&shy;search sci&shy;ent&shy;ist at RIC and an

                <p>
                    Us&shy;ing drugs to treat pa&shy;tients' pain has been tri&shy;al and er&shy;ror,
                    with phys&shy;i&shy;cians chan&shy;ging dosage or try&shy;ing an&shy;oth&shy;er
                    type of drug if one doesn't work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>The new tech&shy;no&shy;logy will al&shy;low phys&shy;i&shy;cians to see what
                    part of the brain is ac&shy;tiv&shy;ated dur&shy;ing an in&shy;di&shy;vidu&shy;al's
                    pain and choose the spe&shy;cif&shy;ic drug to tar&shy;get this spot,</q>
                    Ap&shy;kari&shy;an said. <q>It also will provide more evid&shy;ence-based
                    meas&shy;ure&shy;ments. Phys&shy;i&shy;cians will be able to meas&shy;ure how
                    the pa&shy;tient's pain re&shy;gion is af&shy;fected by the drug.</q>

                <p>
                    Cur&shy;rently, placebo re&shy;sponse is primar&shy;ily stud&shy;ied in healthy
                    sub&shy;jects with&shy;in con&shy;trolled ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment&shy;al
                    set&shy;tings. While such ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ments aid un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing
                    of the bio&shy;lo&shy;gic&shy;al and be&shy;ha&shy;vi&shy;or&shy;al
                    un&shy;der&shy;pin&shy;ning of placebo re&shy;sponse in ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ment&shy;al
                    (ap&shy;plied) pain, they trans&shy;late poorly to the clin&shy;ic, where pain is mainly
                    chron&shy;ic in nature, Ba&shy;liki said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this new study and for the first time, sci&shy;ent&shy;ists used func&shy;tion&shy;al
                    mag&shy;net&shy;ic res&shy;on&shy;ance ima&shy;ging (fMRI) com&shy;bined with a
                    stand&shy;ard clin&shy;ic&shy;al tri&shy;al design to de&shy;rive an un&shy;biased
                    brain-based neur&shy;o&shy;lo&shy;gic&shy;al mark&shy;er to pre&shy;dict
                    an&shy;al&shy;gesia as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ated with placebo treat&shy;ment in
                    pa&shy;tients with chron&shy;ic knee os&shy;teoarth&shy;rit&shy;is pain.
                    Sci&shy;ent&shy;ists showed placebo pill in&shy;ges&shy;tion is as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ated
                    with a strong an&shy;al&shy;gesia ef&shy;fect, with more than half of the pa&shy;tients
                    re&shy;port&shy;ing sig&shy;ni&shy;fic&shy;ant pain re&shy;lief.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If fu&shy;ture sim&shy;il&shy;ar stud&shy;ies can fur&shy;ther ex&shy;pand and
                    even&shy;tu&shy;ally provide a brain-based pre&shy;dict&shy;ive best-ther&shy;apy
                    op&shy;tion for in&shy;di&shy;vidu&shy;al pa&shy;tients, it would
                    dra&shy;mat&shy;ic&shy;ally de&shy;crease un&shy;ne&shy;ces&shy;sary ex&shy;pos&shy;ure
                    of pa&shy;tients to in&shy;ef&shy;fect&shy;ive ther&shy;apies and de&shy;crease the
                    dur&shy;a&shy;tion and mag&shy;nitude of pain suf&shy;fer&shy;ing and opioid use,
                    Ba&shy;liki and Ap&shy;kari&shy;an said.

                    the brain sim&shy;pli&shy;fies com&shy;plex pat&shy;terns, much in
                    the same way that 'lossless' mu&shy;sic com&shy;pres&shy;sion formats
                    re&shy;duce au&shy;dio files, by re&shy;mov&shy;ing re&shy;dund&shy;ant
                    data and identi&shy;fy&shy;ing pat&shy;terns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a long held the&shy;ory that the sub&shy;con&shy;scious mind
                    can re&shy;cog&shy;nise pat&shy;terns with&shy;in com&shy;plex data and
                    that we are hard&shy;wired to find simple pat&shy;terns pleas&shy;ur&shy;able.
                    Dr Nich&shy;olas Hud&shy;son used 'lossless' mu&shy;sic com&shy;pres&shy;sion
                    pro&shy;grams to mim&shy;ic the brain's abil&shy;ity to con&shy;dense au&shy;dio
                    in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion. He com&shy;pared the amount of
                    com&shy;press&shy;ib&shy;il&shy;ity of ran&shy;dom noise to a wide range of
                    mu&shy;sic in&shy;clud&shy;ing clas&shy;sic&shy;al, techno, rock, and pop, and
                    found that, while ran&shy;dom noise could only be com&shy;pressed to 86% of its
                    ori&shy;gin&shy;al file size, and techno, rock, and pop to about 60%, the
                    ap&shy;par&shy;ently com&shy;plex Beeth&shy;oven's 3rd Sym&shy;phony
                    com&shy;pressed to 40%.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr Nich&shy;olas Hud&shy;son says <q>En&shy;dur&shy;ing mu&shy;sic&shy;al
                    mas&shy;ter&shy;pieces, des&shy;pite ap&shy;par&shy;ent com&shy;plex&shy;ity,
                    pos&shy;sess high com&shy;press&shy;ib&shy;il&shy;ity</q> and that it is this
                    com&shy;press&shy;ib&shy;il&shy;ity that we re&shy;spond to. So wheth&shy;er
                    you are a die hard clas&shy;si&shy;cist or a pop diva it seems that we chose
                    the mu&shy;sic we prefer, not by simply listen&shy;ing to it, but by
                    cal&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing its com&shy;press&shy;ib&shy;il&shy;ity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a com&shy;poser -- if you want im&shy;mor&shy;tal&shy;ity, write mu&shy;sic
                    which sounds com&shy;plex but that, in terms of its data, is re&shy;du&shy;cible
                    to simple pat&shy;terns.
