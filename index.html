                Hal&shy;loween is here again. That means your co-work&shy;ers have planted sur&shy;prise
                spiders around the of&shy;fice. You’ve been in&shy;vited to a haunted hayride. Your
                neigh&shy;bor’s yard has a full cemetery, rigged with mo&shy;tion de&shy;tect&shy;ors and
                pop-up zom&shy;bies. Chick&shy;en-livered from the start, I have al&shy;ways dreaded this
                time of year. Haunted houses, ghost tours and hor&shy;ror film fests are not my thing, and
                why people love hav&shy;ing the day&shy;lights scared out of them com&shy;pletely
                es&shy;capes me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I de&shy;cided to try to un&shy;der&shy;stand my friends who are on the lookout for thrills
                this time of year. As it turns out, there are many pos&shy;sible reas&shy;ons some people
                like to be scared stiff. Each per&shy;son’s threshold for ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ences that
                pro&shy;voke fear is made up of a unique re&shy;cipe that blends nature and nur&shy;ture.
                <q>The in&shy;gredi&shy;ents vary from per&shy;son to per&shy;son,</q> said Frank
                Far&shy;ley, a psy&shy;cho&shy;lo&shy;gist at Temple Uni&shy;versity and a former pres&shy;
                id&shy;ent of the Amer&shy;ic&shy;an Psy&shy;cho&shy;lo&shy;gic&shy;al As&shy;so&shy;ci
                &shy;ation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Far&shy;ley is in&shy;ter&shy;ested in what draws cer&shy;tain people to ex&shy;treme
                be&shy;ha&shy;vi&shy;ors, like driv&shy;ing race&shy;cars, climb&shy;ing Mount Everest and
                fly&shy;ing hot air bal&shy;loons across oceans. In the 1980s, he coined the term <q>Type
                T</q> per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ity to refer to the be&shy;ha&shy;vi&shy;or&shy;al
                pro&shy;file of thrill-seekers. What makes someone thrill-seek&shy;ing, he said, comes down
                to a mix of genes, en&shy;vir&shy;on&shy;ment and early de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dav&shy;id Za&shy;ld, a neuro&shy;psy&shy;cho&shy;lo&shy;gist at Vander&shy;bilt
                Uni&shy;versity, stud&shy;ies one piece of the equa&shy;tion. His re&shy;search partly
                fo&shy;cuses on dopam&shy;ine, a chem&shy;ic&shy;al in&shy;volved in our brain’s
                re&shy;sponse to re&shy;ward. In the past, he has found that people who lack what he calls
                “brakes” on dopam&shy;ine re&shy;lease tend to pur&shy;sue thrill&shy;ing activ&shy;it
                &shy;ies.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you go to a haunted house, you’re grap&shy;pling with a con&shy;flict, Dr. Za&shy;ld
                said:<q>The ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence could either be fun or ter&shy;ri&shy;fy&shy;ing, and
                how you weigh that bal&shy;ance could de&shy;pend in part on dopam&shy;ine levels.</q> <q>
                Hav&shy;ing a great&shy;er amount of dopam&shy;ine pushes someone to pur&shy;sue the goal
                of ex&shy;cite&shy;ment,</q> he said, <q>where&shy;as someone who ba&shy;sic&shy;ally has less
                dopam&shy;ine is more likely to hold back and say, ‘No, this isn’t worth it to me.’</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                So&shy;cially, we get cues about how to re&shy;spond to fear from those around us, said
                Mar&shy;gee Kerr, a so&shy;ci&shy;olo&shy;gist and au&shy;thor of the book “Scream:
                Chilling Ad&shy;ven&shy;tures in the Sci&shy;ence of Fear.” Early on, that’s tak&shy;ing
                notes from our par&shy;ents about how to deal with dis&shy;tress. Later, ex&shy;per&shy;i
                &shy;en&shy;cing stress&shy;ful situ&shy;ations with oth&shy;ers can cul&shy;tiv&shy;ate
                so&shy;cial bonds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of that has to do with emo&shy;tion&shy;al con&shy;ta&shy;gion, or a com&shy;mun
                &shy;al re&shy;sponse to shared ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ences, Dr. Kerr said. If your friend
                is cap&shy;tiv&shy;ated by the hor&shy;ror movie you are watch&shy;ing to&shy;geth&shy;er,
                you pro&shy;cess that by re&shy;cre&shy;at&shy;ing the same feel&shy;ing in your own mind, and
                that can bring you closer to&shy;geth&shy;er. People also tend to hold onto memor&shy;ies
                of fear more in&shy;tensely, she said, so if you have pos&shy;it&shy;ive as&shy;so&shy;ci
                &shy;ations with a scary situ&shy;ation, like go&shy;ing to a haunted house, you’ll likely
                want to do it again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear-seek&shy;ing can also be a way of test&shy;ing one&shy;self. Josh Ran&shy;dall and
                Kristjan Thor, cre&shy;at&shy;ors of Black&shy;out, a haunted house ex&shy;per&shy;i
                &shy;ence that con&shy;sist&shy;ently tops rank&shy;ings of “Most Ex&shy;treme Haunted
                Houses,” said they see many people com&shy;ing to their events with a goal of self-for&shy;
                ti&shy;fic&shy;a&shy;tion. “It’s al&shy;most like a dare to them&shy;selves,” Mr. Thor
                said. “People want to be able to con&shy;quer something.”
            </p>
            <p>
                For many, be&shy;ing scared is a jolt&shy;ing es&shy;cape from daily life. When im&shy;mersed
                in a scary situ&shy;ation, you can sus&shy;pend your dis&shy;be&shy;lief and live in the
                mo&shy;ment — and that loss of con&shy;trol can feel really good. This is key for
                Black&shy;out, Mr. Ran&shy;dall said: <blockquote>For a fi&shy;nite peri&shy;od of time,
                that audi&shy;ence mem&shy;ber can turn off the real world, and live in a fantasy world.
                </blockquote>
            <p>
                After talk&shy;ing with the ex&shy;perts, I was start&shy;ing to see why some friends love
                get&shy;ting spooked. But why do I hate be&shy;ing scared so much?
            </p>
            <p>
                It could be be&shy;cause I was nev&shy;er ex&shy;posed to hor&shy;ror movies or haunted houses
                grow&shy;ing up, so by the time I did ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence these things, I was
                ill-pre&shy;pared. It could be that the re&shy;gions in my  brain in&shy;volved in cod&shy;ing
                fear and anxi&shy;ety are more sens&shy;it&shy;ive. Most likely, it is a mix of many
                dif&shy;fer&shy;ent factors. Re&shy;gard&shy;less of the reas&shy;on though, <q>it’s
                per&shy;fectly O.K. not to like scary things,</q> Dr. Kerr said.
            </p>
            <p>
                For people who can&shy;not fathom sit&shy;ting out a haunted house, it’s im&shy;port&shy;ant
                not to co&shy;erce your more cau&shy;tious friends in&shy;to do&shy;ing something they do
                not want to, Dr. Kerr said. “That can com&shy;pound the fear, and make it even worse.” So,
                for any friends who were think&shy;ing of in&shy;vit&shy;ing me to the haunted house this
                week&shy;end, save your breath — I have a doc&shy;tor’s note.

            <h3>Face&shy;book Can Tell You What to Ex&shy;pect in the Vot&shy;ing Booth</h3>
            <p class="first-paragraph">
                Face&shy;book is us&shy;ing its enorm&shy;ous reach to get out the in&shy;formed vote on
                Elec&shy;tion Day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The so&shy;cial me&shy;dia gi&shy;ant has cre&shy;ated a vote plan&shy;ner tool that shows
                users what can&shy;did&shy;ates and is&shy;sues will be on their bal&shy;lots on Nov. 8,
                in&shy;clud&shy;ing loc&shy;al, state and na&shy;tion&shy;al choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tool was cre&shy;ated with data col&shy;lec&shy;ted from elec&shy;tion of&shy;fi
                &shy;cials by the non&shy;par&shy;tis&shy;an re&shy;search group Cen&shy;ter for Tech&shy;
                no&shy;logy and Civic Life. It also shows where each can&shy;did&shy;ate stands on
                ma&shy;jor is&shy;sues.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We wanted to help people pre&shy;pare for the elec&shy;tion and make it as easy as
                pos&shy;sible to pre&shy;pare,” said Jeremy Ga&shy;len, a product mar&shy;ket&shy;ing
                man&shy;ager at Face&shy;book.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to Face&shy;book, only about 20 states mail out samples be&shy;fore an
                elec&shy;tion, mak&shy;ing it hard for voters to be truly in&shy;formed be&shy;fore they
                make their choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The com&shy;pany has also made it pos&shy;sible for users to share their choices with
                friends be&shy;cause <q>many people look to friends and fam&shy;ily for in&shy;form&shy;a
                &shy;tion and guid&shy;ance about how to vote,</q>Mr. Ga&shy;len said.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Face&shy;book also real&shy;ized that vot&shy;ing is a private mat&shy;ter for most
                people. While the com&shy;pany gen&shy;er&shy;ally en&shy;cour&shy;ages people to make
                pub&shy;lic the in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion they post to the plat&shy;form, people must opt
                in to make their vote plan&shy;ner in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion vis&shy;ible to friends who
                have also used the tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Face&shy;book began work&shy;ing on the tool six months ago as part of its work to
                pro&shy;mote civic en&shy;gage&shy;ment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The com&shy;pany has sent out Elec&shy;tion Day re&shy;mind&shy;ers since 2008, and it
                sends such no&shy;ti&shy;fic&shy;a&shy;tions in 47 coun&shy;tries. In Janu&shy;ary, it
                in&shy;tro&shy;duced a voter re&shy;gis&shy;tra&shy;tion re&shy;mind&shy;er to co&shy;in
                &shy;cide with the United States pres&shy;id&shy;en&shy;tial primar&shy;ies and it ran live
                broad&shy;casts of this year’s pres&shy;id&shy;en&shy;tial de&shy;bates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can also save and print out their choices and bring them to the bal&shy;lot box, where
                phones are gen&shy;er&shy;ally pro&shy;hib&shy;ited.

            <h3>After You Strengthen Your Pass&shy;words, Here’s How to Store Them</h3>
            <p class="first-paragraph">
                THE re&shy;cent rev&shy;el&shy;a&shy;tion that the ac&shy;count in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion
                of at least 500 mil&shy;lion Ya&shy;hoo users was stolen in 2014 was a big re&shy;mind
                &shy;er that we all need to be smarter about our di&shy;git&shy;al se&shy;cur&shy;ity. That
                in&shy;cludes our smart&shy;phones, which are in&shy;creas&shy;ingly the re&shy;pos&shy;it
                &shy;or&shy;ies for all sorts of in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion about our di&shy;git&shy;al
                lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Turn&shy;ing our smart&shy;phones in&shy;to per&shy;son&shy;al data fort&shy;resses
                re&shy;quires the use of strong pass&shy;words — and nev&shy;er us&shy;ing the same
                pass&shy;word for dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ser&shy;vices. For&shy;tu&shy;nately, there are
                plenty of apps that can help you re&shy;mem&shy;ber all those pass&shy;words.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dash&shy;lane, which is free to down&shy;load for iOS and An&shy;droid devices, is an
                ex&shy;cel&shy;lent se&shy;cure pass&shy;word sys&shy;tem. The app, which is es&shy;sen
                &shy;tially a di&shy;git&shy;al strong&shy;box for all your on&shy;line keys, has just one
                mas&shy;ter pass&shy;word to re&shy;mem&shy;ber. After you enter that pass&shy;word (which
                should be very strong), you have ac&shy;cess to all your oth&shy;er pass&shy;words
                in&shy;side the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means people can move bey&shy;ond us&shy;ing easy-to-re&shy;mem&shy;ber pass&shy;words
                like “123456” and use longer, more com&shy;plex pass&shy;words that are more dif&shy;fi
                &shy;cult for hack&shy;ers to crack. To help, Dash&shy;lane has a pass&shy;word gen&shy;er
                &shy;at&shy;or that users can cus&shy;tom&shy;ize, for in&shy;stance by vary&shy;ing the
                length of pass&shy;words or spe&shy;cify&shy;ing wheth&shy;er they should in&shy;clude
                non&shy;letter sym&shy;bols.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dash&shy;lane has a built-in browser that is de&shy;signed to be se&shy;cure, so people can
                shop or bank on&shy;line with few&shy;er wor&shy;ries about hav&shy;ing their in&shy;form
                &shy;a&shy;tion com&shy;prom&shy;ised. It also al&shy;lows users to se&shy;curely share
                pass&shy;words with oth&shy;ers — a use&shy;ful fea&shy;ture for any&shy;one with shared
                ac&shy;counts.

                    Go&shy;ing on a group trip for your next va&shy;ca&shy;tion is a way to meet

                    There are hun&shy;dreds of op&shy;tions when it comes to pick&shy;ing a group trip.
                    Here, Ms. Pod&shy;ja&shy;vorsek shares her ad&shy;vice on find&shy;ing the best one for

                    <li><div>MATCH A TRIP TO YOUR STYLE All</div>
                        group trips to the same des&shy;tin&shy;a&shy;tion aren’t cre&shy;ated equal, and
                        it’s im&shy;port&shy;ant to book one based on your pri&shy;or&shy;it&shy;ies — some
                        are activ&shy;ity-based, while oth&shy;ers fo&shy;cus on cul&shy;ture, gast&shy;ro
                        &shy;nomy or lux&shy;ury ac&shy;com&shy;mod&shy;a&shy;tions. If you’re in&shy;ter
                        &shy;ested in Tuscan wine, for ex&shy;ample, But&shy;ter&shy;field &amp;
                        Robin&shy;son and Back&shy;roads of&shy;fer bike tours of Tuscany, while the
                        it&shy;in&shy;er&shy;ar&shy;ies for the re&shy;gion from Aber&shy;crom&shy;bie
                        &amp; Kent in&shy;clude ac&shy;cess to some pres&shy;ti&shy;gi&shy;ous
                        winer&shy;ies and high-end meals.Trips from Glo&shy;bus and Tra&shy;fal&shy;gar
                        vis&shy;it more winer&shy;ies that are less ex&shy;clus&shy;ive; these trips also
                        cost less.

                    <li><div>THE CASE FOR A SMAL&shy;LER GROUP</div>
                        Gen&shy;er&shy;ally, a group trip shouldn’t have more than 16 people, Ms. Pod&shy;
                        ja&shy;vorsek said.<q>Everything takes longer when you have more people, in&shy;
                            clud&shy;ing hotel check-in and meals,</q> she said. Also, lar&shy;ger groups
                        rely on buses for trans&shy;port&shy;a&shy;tion, which are too big to get in&shy;to
                        the city cen&shy;ters of many small towns, es&shy;pe&shy;cially in Europe. But a
                        be&shy;ne&shy;fit of trav&shy;el&shy;ing with a lar&shy;ger group is the price —
                        these trips are usu&shy;ally less ex&shy;pens&shy;ive than their smal&shy;ler
                        coun&shy;ter&shy;parts.

                        Many group trips aren’t ideal if you’re trav&shy;el&shy;ing with young
                        chil&shy;dren or teen&shy;agers, while some are meant spe&shy;cific&shy;ally for
                        fam&shy;il&shy;ies. Ad&shy;ven&shy;tures by Dis&shy;ney, Back&shy;roads, But&shy;
                        ter&shy;field &amp; Robin&shy;son, Tauck Bridges, Tra&shy;fal&shy;gar and Cox &amp;
                        Kings of&shy;fer high-qual&shy;ity fam&shy;ily-friendly group trips.
