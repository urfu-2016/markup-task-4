            <h3>John Wick co-director reportedly wanted for Deadpool 2</h3>
            <p>Following the surprise news earlier this week that
                Tim Miller has vacated the director’s chair on Deadpool 2,
                it seems that 20th Century Fox is wasting little time in securing a replacement.</p>

            <p>According to Mashable, the studio is keen on John Wick co-director David Leitch,

                and Deadpool, having served as stunt coordinator on X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He’s also

            <h3>'Inferno' Has a Meltdown, 'Madea' is #1 Again & 'Doctor Strange' Opens with &#36;86M Overseas</h3>
            <p>Sony's Inferno experienced an opening weekend meltdown as the third film in the Robert Langdon
                series fell &#3610; million shy of expectations. As a result, and thanks to a strong second
                weekend
                hold, Tyler Perry's Boo! A Madea Halloween scored a second weekend atop the box office,
                dropping
                just 41% from its opening weekend. Meanwhile, Disney and Marvel's Doctor Strange stormed the
                international box office. The latest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe opened in
                approximately half the overseas markets where it brought in an estimated &#36;86 million
                ahead of its domestic release next weekend. With an estimated &#36;16.67 million Boo! A Madea
                Halloween took the #1 spot at the weekend box office domestically for a second week in a row.
                The film's cume has now grown to &#36;52 million as it fell just 41% in its second weekend, a
                spectacular performance following the film's &#36;28.5 million opening last weekend. As noted
                in our weekend preview, Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection »</p>
