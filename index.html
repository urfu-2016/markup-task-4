            <h3>Cambodian Orders Inquiry Into Killings</h3>
            <p>
                A ranking security official in Pnompenh said he was shocked
                by news that hun dreds of bodies had been seen floating in the Mekong River and that he
                had ordered an immediate investigation. He said that no responsible official had ordered
                a mass execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lieut. Col. Kim Eng Kourou deth, chief of army intelligence, said that he did not know
                what had happened, but that he assumed the dead might have been the victims of the wrath
                of a population aroused by the collusion between Viet namese residents of Cambodia
                and the Vietcong and North Vietnamese forces that had in vaded Cambodia.
            </p>
            <p>
                A French Roman Catholic priest in Neak Luong, a town on the Mekong River, estimated today that
                about 1,000 bodies had floated downstream since last Monday afternoon. Many of the bodies were tied
                together in groups of up to 10, and many also had their hands tied.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neak Luong is midway be tween Pnompenh, about 40 miles upstream, and the point at which the Mekong
                crosses into South Vietnam. No bodies have been seen in the river at the capital and as far down stream
                at the village of Meat Krasar, eight miles down from Pnompenh. The assumption is, therefore,
                that the bodies were dumped into the Mekong in the stretch between Meat Krasar and here.
            </p>
            <p>
                At a military briefing in Pnompenh today, Maj. Am Rong said that the Government wanted to protect
                the rights of innocent Vietnamese, but he did not list any security meas ures that had been taken.

            <h3>Sisco Drops Jordan Visit After Anti‐U.S. Riots</h3>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON, April 16 (AP)—Joseph J. Sisco, Assist ant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South
                Asian Af fairs, has decided not to visit Jordan on his present tour of the area because of the vio lent
                anti‐American demonstra tions yesterday in Amman, the State Department announced today.
            </p>
            <p>
                “In view of recent develop ments in Jordan, Mr. Sisco de cided to defer his planned stop in Amman,”
                Robert J. McClos key, the department press of ficer, said at a news confer ence. Mr. McCloskey said
                that this left open the possibility that Mr. Sisco would go to Amman at another time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mr. Sisco is in Israel after visits to the United Arab Re public and Cyprus. He had been scheduled
                to go to Amman to morrow for a one‐day visit that was to have included a meet ing with King Hussein.
            </p>
            <p>

                Mr. McCloskey said that the dropping of Amman from Mr. Sisco's itinerary was “the only change of plans
                we know of now.” Mr. Sisco is planning to go to Beirut, Lebanon and from there to Teheran, Iran,to
                at tend a conference of United States ambassadors in the Mid dle East and South Asia on April 20 and 21.

            <h3>The Ultra Secret</h3>
            <p>
                This book reveals the greatest secret of World War II after the atom bomb. It is a must for
                World War II and Intelligence buffs. But it has to be read with caution.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Ultra Secret" tells how the British and the Americans exploited the information they obtained
                from cracking German messages enciphered with a cipher machine named the "Enigma." So valuable was this
                intelligence that it was given a special security classification, "Ultra," which the intelligence
                itself came to be called. The author, an R.A.F. officer, was put in charge of distributing Ultra
                under tight security to Churchill and to commands around the world. Winterbotham therefore saw
                much of the output and in this book has correlated it with the events of the war.
            </p>
            <p>The stories he tells are revelations.</p>
            <p>
                During the Battle of Britain, Ultra told the R.A.F. Fighter Command well in advance of radar detection
                how many bombers would be thrown against England and when. This enabled the British to parcel out
                their few fighters so that some would always be available to attack an oncoming wave. These tactics
                denied the Germans command of the air over England and consequently any possibility of invasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                On July 15, 1928, Polish cryptanalysts noticed a decided change in the letter frequencies of German
                army cryptograms, which they were intercepting. The Poles quickly concluded that the Germans had begun
                using the Enigma, which was invented and publicly sold early in the 1920's. Purchase of one of
                the commercial models showed that the Reichswehr had altered it for secrecy.

            <p>
                In 1932, the Polish Biuro Szyfrów (cipher bureau) got additional manpower in the form of three young
                mathematicians. Henryk Zygalski, Mann Rejewski and Jerzy Rozycki. They had achieved a partial solution
                in their office, hidden in the forest of Pyry outside Warsaw, when Poland's French allies furnished
                some key Enigma documents. Major Gustave Bertrand of French cryptographic espionage had obtained them
                from a Reichswehr cipher unit employe, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, who wanted money. (Bertrand has told this
                story in his book, "Enigma.") With this help, the Poles completed their solution, and on July 26, 1939,
                presented two reconstructions of the machine to the French and two to the English.
            </p>
            <p>
                These enabled the British codebreaking unit at Bletchley, a small town 50 miles northwest of London,
                to solve the later variations of the machine and other machines used for different branches of the
                German armed forces. Security forbade Winterbotham from recounting these details, but he properly
                and generously credits the achievement. To generate up-to-the-minute solutions for these other
                machines, incidentally, the Bletchley geniuses evolved perhaps the first modern electronic computer,
                which they nicknamed the "Colossus."
            </p>
            <p>
                Why has this story remained under tight wraps so long? It seems that after World War II, Britain
                gathered up as many of the tens of thousands of Enigmas as she could find and later sold them
                to some of the emerging nations. Presumably if she could read Enigma messages in 1940, she could do so
                in 1950. Only recently have these countries replaced their Enigmas with new cryptosystems.
