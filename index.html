                            BAR&shy;TELLA, Ir&shy;aq — Our con&shy;voy
                            had already been tar&shy;geted by sui&shy;cide
                            car bombs three times, over a long day spent
                            un&shy;der fire. So the Ir&shy;aqi forces had
                            brought up a tank, and its main gun kept
                            scan&shy;ning the road ahead to&shy;ward
                            Mo&shy;sul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the shouts star&shy;ted com&shy;ing
                            from be&shy;hind us in&shy;stead, and when
                            I turned to look, I knew right away: Here
                            was Bomb No. 4, seem&shy;ingly out of nowhere.
                            By the time I saw it, the vehicle was maybe
                            70 feet away.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            We were with a unit of elite Ir&shy;aqi
                            coun&shy;terter&shy;ror&shy;ism forces, who
                            on the morn&shy;ing of Oct. 20 were mak&shy;ing
                            their first moves in the broad&shy;er battle
                            to take Mo&shy;sul back from the
                            Is&shy;lam&shy;ic State.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The com&shy;mandos’ first big
                            ob&shy;ject&shy;ive was to sur&shy;round and
                            clear Bar&shy;tella, a mil&shy;it&shy;ant-held
                            town about six miles east of the out&shy;er
                            fringes of Mo&shy;sul. Start&shy;ing out from
                            an Ir&shy;aqi base around 5 a.m., the troops
                            began push&shy;ing east along the main
                            high&shy;way that links the Kur&shy;d&shy;ish
                            re&shy;gion&shy;al cap&shy;it&shy;al, Er&shy;bil,
                            with Mo&shy;sul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Un&shy;der peace&shy;ful cir&shy;cum&shy;stances,
                            that drive would take maybe an hour and a half.
                            But it would take the unit we were with nearly
                            all day just to push three miles in&shy;to
                            Is&shy;lam&shy;ic State ter&shy;rit&shy;ory to
                            the west&shy;ern edge of Bar&shy;tella, where
                            the troops were to cut off the Is&shy;lam&shy;ic
                            State fight&shy;ers holed up in the town,
                            keep&shy;ing them from es&shy;cap&shy;ing to
                            Mo&shy;sul or be&shy;ing re&shy;in&shy;forced
                            from there. There were bombs all along the road,
                            and nearly every vil&shy;lage along the way would
                            be a...

                            People love to in&shy;vade Malta.
                            The Medi&shy;ter&shy;ranean is&shy;land
                            na&shy;tion, situ&shy;ated between
                            Si&shy;cily and Tunisia, counts among its
                            un&shy;wel&shy;come guests the Ro&shy;mans,
                            the Ot&shy;to&shy;mans, Na&shy;po&shy;leon and,
                            in the early 20th cen&shy;tury, hun&shy;dreds of
                            Rus&shy;si&shy;an ar&shy;is&shy;to&shy;crats
                            flee&shy;ing the fall of the czar&shy;ist
                            auto&shy;cracy. For the most part, the Maltese
                            were hav&shy;ing none of this. Na&shy;po&shy;leon
                            was forced out after just two years, and the
                            Knights of Malta — ef&shy;fect&shy;ively, and
                            against all odds — de&shy;feated the Ot&shy;to&shy;man
                            Em&shy;pire’s much lar&shy;ger forces. In Val&shy;letta,
                            Malta’s cap&shy;it&shy;al, people still bring up the
                            Great Siege with enorm&shy;ous pride, boast&shy;ing
                            about it as if they had ac&shy;tu&shy;ally been there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For all of Val&shy;letta’s in&shy;terest in the past —
                            the city is a Un&shy;esco World Her&shy;it&shy;age Site,
                            and the 16th-cen&shy;tury Saint John’s Co-Cathed&shy;ral
                            in the cen&shy;ter of town has been mag&shy;ni&shy;fi&shy;cently
                            pre&shy;served — it has be&shy;come in re&shy;cent years a
                            vi&shy;brant cul&shy;tur&shy;al des&shy;tin&shy;a&shy;tion,
                            with an ap&shy;peal that is both his&shy;tor&shy;ic and
                            mod&shy;ern. The area’s Baroque ar&shy;chi&shy;tec&shy;ture
                            now houses boutique ho&shy;tels in&shy;stead of knights in
                            ar&shy;mor, while none oth&shy;er than Renzo Pi&shy;ano has
                            re&shy;fur&shy;bished the par&shy;lia&shy;ment and
                            his&shy;tor&shy;ic city gate. Art is in&shy;creas&shy;ingly
                            mov&shy;ing in&shy;doors as well, with sev&shy;er&shy;al
                            am&shy;bi&shy;tious gal&shy;ler&shy;ies on the ho&shy;ri&shy;zon,
                            and MUZA, a new Na&shy;tion&shy;al Mu&shy;seum of Fine Arts.

                        <p>
                            Val&shy;letta, like the rest of Malta, is a pas&shy;tiche of
                            his&shy;tor&shy;ic&shy;al in&shy;flu&shy;ences. Its lan&shy;guage
                            has un&shy;der&shy;tones ran&shy;ging from Ar&shy;ab&shy;ic to
                            Itali&shy;an, among a vari&shy;ety of oth&shy;er dia&shy;lects.
                            The same is true of the food, a unique mix of
                            Medi&shy;ter&shy;ranean and North Afric&shy;an
                            in&shy;flu&shy;ences — which, as it turns out, is one
                            of the more pos&shy;it&shy;ive res&shy;ults of all those
                            in&shy;va&shy;sions.

                            By next sum&shy;mer, a spate of ho&shy;tels are sched&shy;uled

                            is Casa El&shy;lul, an eight-suite, neo-Clas&shy;sic&shy;al
                            town&shy;house that mixes the build&shy;ing’s ori&shy;gin&shy;al

                            bath&shy;rooms). Rooms on the top floor, with private
                            ter&shy;races over&shy;look&shy;ing the city, are worth
                            pay&shy;ing ex&shy;tra for.

                            It’s loc&shy;ated on the car&shy;less end of its name&shy;sake
                            street near sev&shy;er&shy;al of the city’s best bars.
                            The own&shy;er and man&shy;ager, Fiona Hili, is of&shy;ten on

                            of&shy;fer&shy;ings. Bottles are paired with a fixed-price menu
                            that in&shy;cludes small plates such as ar&shy;joli
                            (a dip made from sun-dried to&shy;ma&shy;toes, capers,
                            olives and an&shy;chovies) fol&shy;lowed by hearti&shy;er

                            at weekly. The sky-blue walls are covered with old
