                    Hal&shy;loween is here again. That means your co-work&shy;ers have planted sur&shy;prise
                    spiders around the of&shy;fice. You’ve been in&shy;vited to a haunted hayride. Your
                    neigh&shy;bor’s yard has a full cemetery, rigged with mo&shy;tion de&shy;tect&shy;ors and
                    pop-up zom&shy;bies. Chick&shy;en-livered from the start, I have al&shy;ways dreaded this
                    time of year. Haunted houses, ghost tours and hor&shy;ror film fests are not my thing, and
                    why people love hav&shy;ing the day&shy;lights scared out of them com&shy;pletely
                    es&shy;capes me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I de&shy;cided to try to un&shy;der&shy;stand my friends who are on the lookout for
                    thrills this time of year. As it turns out, there are many pos&shy;sible reas&shy;ons
                    some people like to be scared stiff. Each per&shy;son’s threshold for ex&shy;per&shy;i
                    &shy;ences that pro&shy;voke fear is made up of a unique re&shy;cipe that blends nature
                    and nur&shy;ture. <q>The in&shy;gredi&shy;ents vary from per&shy;son to per&shy;son,</q>
                    said Frank Far&shy;ley, a psy&shy;cho&shy;lo&shy;gist at Temple Uni&shy;versity and a
                    former pres&shy;id&shy;ent of the Amer&shy;ic&shy;an Psy&shy;cho&shy;lo&shy;gic&shy;al
                    As&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Far&shy;ley is in&shy;ter&shy;ested in what draws cer&shy;tain people to ex&shy;treme
                    be&shy;ha&shy;vi&shy;ors, like driv&shy;ing race&shy;cars, climb&shy;ing Mount Everest and
                    fly&shy;ing hot air bal&shy;loons across oceans. In the 1980s, he coined the term <q>Type
                    T</q> per&shy;son&shy;al&shy;ity to refer to the be&shy;ha&shy;vi&shy;or&shy;al
                    pro&shy;file of thrill-seekers. What makes someone thrill-seek&shy;ing, he said, comes
                    down to a mix of genes, en&shy;vir&shy;on&shy;ment and early de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment.

                    So&shy;cially, we get cues about how to re&shy;spond to fear from those around us, said
                    Mar&shy;gee Kerr, a so&shy;ci&shy;olo&shy;gist and au&shy;thor of the book <q>Scream:
                    Chilling Ad&shy;ven&shy;tures in the Sci&shy;ence of Fear.</q> Early on, that’s
                    tak&shy;ing notes from our par&shy;ents about how to deal with dis&shy;tress. Later,
                    ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;en&shy;cing stress&shy;ful situ&shy;ations with oth&shy;ers can
                    cul&shy;tiv&shy;ate so&shy;cial bonds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part of that has to do with emo&shy;tion&shy;al con&shy;ta&shy;gion, or a com&shy;mun
                    &shy;al re&shy;sponse to shared ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ences, Dr. Kerr said. If your friend
                    is cap&shy;tiv&shy;ated by the hor&shy;ror movie you are watch&shy;ing to&shy;geth&shy;er,
                    you pro&shy;cess that by re&shy;cre&shy;at&shy;ing the same feel&shy;ing in your own mind,
                    and that can bring you closer to&shy;geth&shy;er. People also tend to hold onto
                    memor&shy;ies of fear more in&shy;tensely, she said, so if you have pos&shy;it&shy;ive
                    as&shy;so&shy;ci&shy;ations with a scary situ&shy;ation, like go&shy;ing to a haunted
                    house, you’ll likely want to do it again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fear-seek&shy;ing can also be a way of test&shy;ing one&shy;self. Josh Ran&shy;dall and
                    Kristjan Thor, cre&shy;at&shy;ors of Black&shy;out, a haunted house ex&shy;per&shy;i
                    &shy;ence that con&shy;sist&shy;ently tops rank&shy;ings of <q>Most Ex&shy;treme Haunted
                    Houses,</q> said they see many people com&shy;ing to their events with a goal of
                    self-for&shy;ti&shy;fic&shy;a&shy;tion. <q>It’s al&shy;most like a dare to them&shy;
                    selves,</q> Mr.Thor said. <q>People want to be able to con&shy;quer something.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For many, be&shy;ing scared is a jolt&shy;ing es&shy;cape from daily life. When
                    im&shy;mersed in a scary situ&shy;ation, you can sus&shy;pend your dis&shy;be&shy;lief
                    and live in the mo&shy;ment — and that loss of con&shy;trol can feel really good.

                    After talk&shy;ing with the ex&shy;perts, I was start&shy;ing to see why some friends love
                    get&shy;ting spooked. But why do I hate be&shy;ing scared so much?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It could be be&shy;cause I was nev&shy;er ex&shy;posed to hor&shy;ror movies or haunted
                    houses grow&shy;ing up, so by the time I did ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;ence these things, I was
                    ill-pre&shy;pared. It could be that the re&shy;gions in my  brain in&shy;volved in
                    cod&shy;ing fear and anxi&shy;ety are more sens&shy;it&shy;ive. Most likely, it is a
                    mix of many dif&shy;fer&shy;ent factors. Re&shy;gard&shy;less of the reas&shy;on
                    though, <q>it’s per&shy;fectly O.K. not to like scary things,</q> Dr. Kerr said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For people who can&shy;not fathom sit&shy;ting out a haunted house, it’s im&shy;port
                    &shy;ant not to co&shy;erce your more cau&shy;tious friends in&shy;to do&shy;ing
                    something they do not want to, Dr. Kerr said. <q>That can com&shy;pound the fear, and
                    make it even worse.</q> So, for any friends who were think&shy;ing of in&shy;vit
                    &shy;ing me to the haunted house this week&shy;end, save your breath — I have a
                    doc&shy;tor’s note.

                    Face&shy;book is us&shy;ing its enorm&shy;ous reach to get out the in&shy;formed vote on
                    Elec&shy;tion Day.

                <p>
                    The so&shy;cial me&shy;dia gi&shy;ant has cre&shy;ated a vote plan&shy;ner tool that shows
                    users what can&shy;did&shy;ates and is&shy;sues will be on their bal&shy;lots on Nov. 8,
                    in&shy;clud&shy;ing loc&shy;al, state and na&shy;tion&shy;al choices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tool was cre&shy;ated with data col&shy;lec&shy;ted from elec&shy;tion of&shy;fi
                    &shy;cials by the non&shy;par&shy;tis&shy;an re&shy;search group Cen&shy;ter for Tech&shy;

                    Ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to Face&shy;book, only about 20 states mail out samples be&shy;fore an
                    elec&shy;tion, mak&shy;ing it hard for voters to be truly in&shy;formed be&shy;fore they
                    make their choices.

                <p>
                    The com&shy;pany has also made it pos&shy;sible for users to share their choices with
                    friends be&shy;cause <q>many people look to friends and fam&shy;ily for in&shy;form&shy;a

                <p>
                    But Face&shy;book also real&shy;ized that vot&shy;ing is a private mat&shy;ter for most
                    people. While the com&shy;pany gen&shy;er&shy;ally en&shy;cour&shy;ages people to make
                    pub&shy;lic the in&shy;form&shy;a&shy;tion they post to the plat&shy;form, people must opt

                    have also used the tool.

                <p>
                    Face&shy;book began work&shy;ing on the tool six months ago as part of its work to
                    pro&shy;mote civic en&shy;gage&shy;ment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The com&shy;pany has sent out Elec&shy;tion Day re&shy;mind&shy;ers since 2008, and it
                    sends such no&shy;ti&shy;fic&shy;a&shy;tions in 47 coun&shy;tries. In Janu&shy;ary, it
                    in&shy;tro&shy;duced a voter re&shy;gis&shy;tra&shy;tion re&shy;mind&shy;er to co&shy;in
                    &shy;cide with the United States pres&shy;id&shy;en&shy;tial primar&shy;ies and it ran

                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can also save and print out their choices and bring them to the bal&shy;lot box,
                    where phones are gen&shy;er&shy;ally pro&shy;hib&shy;ited.

                    are more dif&shy;fi &shy;cult for hack&shy;ers to crack. To help, Dash&shy;lane has a
                    pass&shy;word gen&shy;er &shy;at&shy;or that users can cus&shy;tom&shy;ize, for

                    Dash&shy;lane has a built-in browser that is de&shy;signed to be se&shy;cure, so people
                    can shop or bank on&shy;line with few&shy;er wor&shy;ries about hav&shy;ing their
                    in&shy;form &shy;a&shy;tion com&shy;prom&shy;ised. It also al&shy;lows users to
                    se&shy;curely share pass&shy;words with oth&shy;ers — a use&shy;ful fea&shy;ture for
                    any&shy;one with shared ac&shy;counts.

                        group trips to the same des&shy;tin&shy;a&shy;tion aren’t cre&shy;ated equal, and
                        it’s im&shy;port&shy;ant to book one based on your pri&shy;or&shy;it&shy;ies — some
                        are activ&shy;ity-based, while oth&shy;ers fo&shy;cus on cul&shy;ture, gast&shy;ro
                        &shy;nomy or lux&shy;ury ac&shy;com&shy;mod&shy;a&shy;tions. If you’re in&shy;ter

                        Robin&shy;son and Back&shy;roads of&shy;fer bike tours of Tuscany, while the

                        vis&shy;it more winer&shy;ies that are less ex&shy;clus&shy;ive; these trips also
                        cost less.

                        Gen&shy;er&shy;ally, a group trip shouldn’t have more than 16 people, Ms. Pod&shy;
                        ja&shy;vorsek said.<q>Everything takes longer when you have more people, in&shy;
                            clud&shy;ing hotel check-in and meals,</q> she said. Also, lar&shy;ger groups
                        rely on buses for trans&shy;port&shy;a&shy;tion, which are too big to get in&shy;to
                        the city cen&shy;ters of many small towns, es&shy;pe&shy;cially in Europe. But a
                        be&shy;ne&shy;fit of trav&shy;el&shy;ing with a lar&shy;ger group is the price —
                        these trips are usu&shy;ally less ex&shy;pens&shy;ive than their smal&shy;ler
                        coun&shy;ter&shy;parts.

                        Many group trips aren’t ideal if you’re trav&shy;el&shy;ing with young
                        chil&shy;dren or teen&shy;agers, while some are meant spe&shy;cific&shy;ally for
