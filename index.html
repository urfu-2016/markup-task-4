                        <p>There may be demons, plagues and the all horrors of the apocalypse, but there’s
                            no room for any spandex superheroes in a graphic novel that its publishers are 
                            claiming is the longest ever produced. The only superpowers that feature in the
                            10,000 panels of the Kingstone Bible are wielded in the good fight, as the
                            greatest story ever told gets a 12-volume comic-book adaptation.</p>

                        <p>Christian publisher Kingstone has been working on the project for seven years,
                            using more than 45 illustrators to pull together what it is calling “the most 
                            complete graphic-novel adaptation of the Bible ever published”, at over 2,000
                            pages, in either 12 paperback volumes or three larger hardcover volumes. 
                            Art Ayris, the founder of Kingstone, says the publisher plumped for the 
                            comics format because “the interplay of text and images allows one to convey
                            a large amount of content in an abbreviated form”.</p>
                        <p>“A novice to religion who had never read the Bible before would be able to
                            read through this graphic novel trilogy and have an understanding of some of
                            the key narratives as well as key doctrines in the different books,” he says,
                            “especially the Epistles. We have never seen this as a substitute for Bible
                            reading but as a complement to help people ‘see’ the scriptures in a 
                            new light.”</p>

                        <p>Some of the books of the Bible were more difficult to adapt than others, Ayris
                            admits, but artists were selected to fit the text. “For the book of Revelation we
                            used a top horror artist who had been with Marvel, and it was a great fit for the
                            powerful imagery in that book. Where we dealt with Bible reporting on major 
                            slaughter, rapes, adultery etc, we tried to honestly communicate but not be over
                            the top with the graphic portrayals.”</p>
                        <p>Ayris says that Kingstone is aiming the Bible at preteen readers and young 
                            adults, but that the publisher’s largest social media demographic is males 
                            between the ages of 18 and 29.</p>
                        <blockquote>“To a lot of people, the Bible is a big daunting book full of 
                            hard to pronounce names and seemingly unrelated stories. However, we come at it
                            from the understanding that it is document of divine revelation about the nature
                            and character of God, his dealings with mankind, a chronicle of ancient history
                            as well as a revelation of the future.”</blockquote>
                        <p>Even though the Bible is constructed from 66 books it is “one unified story”, 
                            Ayris continues, story the publisher has done its best to respect. “The Kingstone
                            Bible may be a very unorthodox approach to scripture but we have tried to be very
                            orthodox in theological constructs.”</p>

                        <p>At least one type of social learning, or the ability to learn from observing
                            others’ actions, is processed by individual neurons within a region of the human
                            brain called the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), according to a study
                            published today (September 6) in Nature Communications. The work is the first 
                            direct analysis in humans of the neuronal activity that encodes information 
                            about others’ behavior.</p>

                        <blockquote>“The idea [is] that there could be an area that’s specialized for 
                            processing things about other people,” says Matthew Apps, a neuroscientist at 
                            the University of Oxford who was not involved with the study. “How we think 
                            about other people might use distinct processes from how 
                            we might think about ourselves.”

                    <td><p>During the social learning experiments, the University of 
                        California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and CalTech–based research team recorded the 
                        activity of individual neurons in the brains of epilepsy patients. The patients
                        were undergoing a weeks-long procedure at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center
                        in which their brains were implanted with electrodes to locate the origin of 
                        their epileptic seizures. Access to this patient population was key to the study.
                        “It’s a very rare dataset,” says Apps. “It really does add a lot to the story.” 
                        With data streaming out of the patients’ brains, the researchers taught the subjects
                        to play a card game on a laptop. Each turn, the patients could select from one of
                        two decks of face-down cards: the cards either gave $10 or $100 in virtual
                        winnings, or subtracted $10 or $100. In one deck, 70 percent of the cards were 
                        winning cards, while in the other only 30 percent were. The goal was 
                        to rack up the most money.</p>

                            round to observe two other “players,” virtual avatars whose moves had been 
                            pre-recorded and later adjusted by the research team to ensure an appropriate 
                            level of experimental variance. These virtual players chose from the same decks 
                            as the subject, and so for every choice the subjects made, they also received 
                            two other data points from which to draw conclusions about the decks.Throughout the 
                            card game, as players made predictions about which deck was better and subsequently 
                            won or lost their virtual money, the researchers collected data on which neurons 
                            were firing and when. “The actual signal that we record is the action potential, 
                            which is arguably a ground truth in the brain—it’s really where biology becomes
                            information,” says Michael Hill, a coauthor of the study now based at the Center
                            for Neuroprosthetics at EPFL in Switzerland.</p>

                        <p>The research aligns with previous neuron studies of observational learning in
                            rodents and non-human primates, and with human fMRI studies, says Steve Chang,
                            a neurobiologist at Yale University who was not involved in the project. “This
                            kind of result gives us a good guideline to target similar regions in the animal
                            brain . . . and see what these neurons do when we causally manipulate them,” he
                            adds. “These results from different angles will eventually all converge to an 
                            interesting picture for social cognition.” For humans, the results also point 
                            to another potential avenue for research in the clinic. “For conditions such 
                            as psychopathy or individuals on the autism spectrum, this sort of hints at 
                            a new target,” says Apps. With a team of colleagues, Apps is currently 
                            investigating if the social difficulties faced by some individuals on the 
                            autism spectrum are due to an absence of activity in response to prediction
                            errors in this brain region.</p>
